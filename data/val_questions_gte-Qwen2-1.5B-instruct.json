The V3 interface between the UE and the V2X Control Function can be secured in the same way as the PC3 interface between the UE and the ProSe Function, as in TS 33.303 [5]; PSK TLS with GBA (Pre-shared Key Transport Layer Security with Generic Bootstrapping Architecture) is used for UE initiated messages, while PSK TLS including option of GBA push are used for network initiated messages.\n\nFor V2X application data, the security requirements are all satisfied by employing application-layer security as defined in other SDOs (e.g. IEEE or ETSI ITS), which is outside the scope of 3GPP.

The operators do not only share the radio network elements, but may also share the radio resources themselves. In addition to this shared radio access network the operators may or may not have additional dedicated radio access networks, like for example, 3G or 2G radio access networks. For E-UTRAN both Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) configuration and Gateway Core Network (GWCN) configuration as defined in TS\u00a023.251\u00a0[24] are supported over the S1 reference point. E-UTRAN terminals shall support shared networks and hence, only functions for \"Supporting UEs\" in TS\u00a023.251\u00a0[24] applies for E-UTRAN Sharing.\nE-UTRAN Radio Access Network Sharing functions is further described in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\nIn networks that support network sharing as defined in TS\u00a023.251\u00a0[24], for a UE in state ECM-CONNECTED, the Handover Restriction List provided by the core-network to the radio access network is also used to inform the radio access network about the Selected PLMN and equivalent PLMNs as defined in TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36].\n\nTo enable the eNodeB to determine which MME to select when forwarding messages from an UE, this functionality defines a routing mechanism (and other related mechanism). A routing mechanism (and other related mechanism) is defined for the MMEs. The routing mechanism is required to find the correct old MME (from the multiple MMEs that are associated with a pool area). When a UE roams out of the pool area and into the area of one or more MMEs that do not know about the internal structure of the pool area where the UE roamed from, the new MME will send the Identification Request message or the Context Request message to the old MME using the GUTI. The routing mechanism in both the MMEs and the eNodeB utilises the fact that every MME that serves a pool area must have its own unique value range of the GUTI parameter within the pool area.\n4.3.11\tE-UTRAN Sharing Function\nE-UTRAN Sharing is an agreement between operators and shall be transparent to the user. This implies that an E-UTRAN UE needs to be able to discriminate between core network operators available in a shared radio access network and that these operators can be handled in the same way as operators in non-shared networks.

This can be done by following the principles specified for GERAN to/from UTRAN intersystem HO. In particular the following principles are applied to E-UTRAN Inter RAT HO design:\n1.\tInter RAT HO is network controlled through source access system. The source access system decides about starting the preparation and provides the necessary information to the target system in the format required by the target system. That is, the source system adapts to the target system. The actual handover execution is decided in the source system.\n2.\tInter RAT HO is backwards handover, i.e. radio resources are prepared in the target 3GPP access system before the UE is commanded by the source 3GPP access system to change to the target 3GPP access system.\n3.\tTo enable backwards handover, and while RAN level interfaces are not available, a control interface exists in CN level.

The source MME selects the target MME based on \"MME selection\" as described in TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[5]. The source MME initiates the handover resource allocation procedure by sending a Forward Relocation Request to the target MME. Information such as UE identity, target eNB id, etc are included in the message.\n3.\tIf the PLMN serving the UE changes, when receiving Forward Relocation Request from source MME, the target MME should verify the PLMN is whether allowed to operate at the present UE location (target TAI) based on the UE subscription information received from HSS. If it is not allowed to operate, the handover is failed.\n\tIf the target access is not satellite access, there is no need to verify UE location. 4.\tThe target MME determines if the serving GW is to be relocated, e.g. due to PLMN change. If the Serving GW is to be relocated, the target SGSN selects the target Serving GW as described in TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[5] on \"Serving GW selection function\", and sends a Create Session Request message to the target serving GW.

As an example, a WLAN access network may utilize EAP re-authentication in order to enable Fast Initial Link Setup (specified in IEEE 802.11ai) and minimize the link-setup delay between the UE and the WLAN access network.\nAn EPC network may optionally support EAP re-authentication for interworking with non-3GPP accesses. Also, the UE may optionally support EAP re-authentication. By using EAP re-authentication, UEs can connect to EPC via non-3GPP access and utilize EPC services with enhanced performance. For example, a UE may experience improved voice-over-IMS service due to the small link-setup delay that occurs when the UE transitions between access points in the non-3GPP access network.\nWhen an EPC network supports EAP re-authentication, the functionality of the 3GPP AAA server/proxy and the procedures over STa, SWa and SWd interfaces shall be enhanced in order to support the applicable procedures specified in RFC\u00a06696\u00a0[85]. Also, when a UE supports EAP re-authentication, the UE shall be enhanced in order to support the functionality of the EAP re-authentication peer RFC\u00a06696\u00a0[85]. EAP re-authentication over the SWu interface (i.e. when the UE establishes a secure connection with the ePDG) is not applicable.\n\n11.1.2\tSupport of EAP Re-authentication Protocol for WLAN Interworking\nSummary based on the input provided by Orange in SP-17XXXX.\n3GPP\nThe procedures for access to 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via non-3GPP access networks have been enhanced in Rel-14 to enable an EPC network to optionally support the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP). ERP allows efficient re-authentication between the UE and a dedicated server that can be located in the TWAP or the 3GPP AAA proxy/server and provides optimized link-setup delay after handover between access points.\nThe Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) (IETF RFC 6696 [1]) is used for authentication of user accessing EPC using non-3GPP access networks. To avoid full EAP authentication when moving from one access point to another one of the same access network, ERP has been defined to ensure efficient re-authentication between the UE and an EAP re-authentication server through any access point.\nIn SA2, TS 23.402, which specifies the procedures for access to EPC via non-3GPP access networks, has been enhanced in Rel-14 to enable an EPC network to optionally support ERP.

Rel-16 Mobile Terminating Early Data Transmission (MT-EDT) allows one downlink data transmission during the random access procedure triggered in response to a paging message. This feature allows the eNB to decide whether to initiate Mobile Terminated EDT procedures towards the UE based on the data size received from the core network. Mobile Terminating Early Data Transmission (MT-EDT) is only supported in EPC.\nSupport for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode (FDD)\nIn Rel-15, signalling overhead and power consumption reductions were introduced by the (mobile-originated) early data transmission (EDT) feature, where data can be transmitted already in Msg3 during the random-access procedure.\nIn Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR). This feature allows eNB to configure uplink resources, in which a UE in IDLE mode can send UL transmission without performing random access procedures. The UE can be potentially configured with a cyclic shift of DMRS, which allows sharing of the preconfigured resources under which up to two users can transmit NPUSCH simultaneously when the NPUSCH transmission is larger than or equal to 64ms for 12-tone allocation. By skipping the random access procedures, the uplink transmission efficiency can be improved and UE power consumption is reduced. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change. Additionally, it is possible to configure the TA as always valid within a given cell.\n\n7.1\tNR small data transmissions in INACTIVE state\nSummary based on the input provided by ZTE Corporation, Sanechips in RP-220154.\nThis work item enables the transmission of small signalling and/or data packets whilst the UE remains in RRC_INACTIVE state. Prior to Rel-17, NR supports RRC_INACTIVE state and UEs with infrequent (periodic and/or non-periodic) data transmission are generally maintained by the network in the RRC_INACTIVE state. Until Rel-16, the RRC_INACTIVE state doesn\u2019t support data transmission. Hence, the UE has to resume the connection (i.e. move to RRC_CONNECTED state) for any DL (MT) and UL (MO) data. Connection setup and subsequently release to INACTIVE state happens for each data transmission however small and infrequent the data packets are. This results in unnecessary power consumption and signalling overhead. \nSome examples of small and infrequent data traffic include Smartphone applications such as: traffic from Instant Messaging services; Heart-beat/keep-alive traffic from IM/email clients and other apps; Push notifications from various applications. Other examples are non-smartphone applications such as: traffic from wearables (periodic positioning information etc); sensors (Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks transmitting temperature, pressure readings periodically or in an event triggered manner etc); smart meters and smart meter networks sending periodic meter readings.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of the Early data transmission feature in NB-IoT?

Significantly reducing the headers, especially for sequential HTTP/2 request responses to the same server, where repeated and redundant information is efficiently compressed. The use of HPACK in HTTP/2 is one of the more significant performance improvements compared to HTTP 1.0 or 1.1. HPACK was defined based on one important assumption, namely the TCP in-order delivery of the different HTTP/2 frame types across all the streams. Thus, the encoder knows in which order the decoder will receive and process the various frames, and how the decoder state will be updated. HTTP/3 does not provide the same deterministic and guaranteed in order delivery mechanism between different HTTP requests. HTTP/3 can avoid this head of line blocking and provide improved performance by delivering to higher layers the HTTP messages in the order they are successfully delivered to the peer. However, if one would use HPACK without modifications, this could result in the decoder blocking or producing the wrong output.

A routing mechanism (and other related mechanism) is defined for the MMEs. The routing mechanism is required to find the correct old MME (from the multiple MMEs that are associated with a pool area). When a UE roams out of the pool area and into the area of one or more MMEs that do not know about the internal structure of the pool area where the UE roamed from, the new MME will send the Identification Request message or the Context Request message to the old MME using the GUTI. The routing mechanism in both the MMEs and the eNodeB utilises the fact that every MME that serves a pool area must have its own unique value range of the GUTI parameter within the pool area.\n4.3.11\tE-UTRAN Sharing Function\nE-UTRAN Sharing is an agreement between operators and shall be transparent to the user.

This is an improvement over Rel-16 wherein the access performance measurements are always conducted over the default QoS flow and, therefore, provide a rough estimate of the RTT / PLR.\n\tWhether the access performance measurements for a data flow are conducted over the default QoS flow (as in Rel-16), or over the same QoS flow used to carry the data flow, is determined by the network during the MA PDU Session establishment.

The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput.

Some of these verticals are mentioned in the annexes of TS\u00a022.261\u00a0[1]:\n-\tAutomotive and other transport (trains, maritime communications),\n-\tTransport, logistics, IoT,\n-\tDiscrete automation,\n-\tElectricity distribution,\n-\tPublic Safety,\n\nAnother aspect of 5G KPIs includes requirements for various combinations of latency and reliability, as well as higher accuracy for positioning. These KPIs are driven by support for both commercial and public safety services. On the commercial side, industrial control, industrial automation, UAV control, and AR are examples of those services. Services such as UAV control will require more precise positioning information that includes altitude, speed, and direction, in addition to horizontal coordinates.\nSupport for Massive Internet of Things (MIoT) brings many new requirements in addition to those for the enhanced KPIs. The expansion of connected things introduces a need for significant improvements in resource efficiency in all system components (e.g. UEs, IoT devices, radio, access network, core network).\nThe 5G system also aims to enhance its capability to meet KPIs that emerging V2X applications require. For these advanced applications, the requirements, such as data rate, reliability, latency, communication range and speed, are made more stringent.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which 5G usage includes the operational aspects that apply to the wide range of IoT devices and services anticipated in the 5G timeframe?

This WI is the evolution of NR sidelink in Release 16.\nThe key functionalities of NR sidelink enhancement are detailed below.\nPower Savings Resource Allocation\nThe SL UE in Mode 2 can support partial sensing-based resource allocation and random resource selection as power saving resource allocation methods. A SL mode 2 TX resource pool can be (pre)configured to enable full sensing only, partial sensing only, random selection only, or any combination(s) thereof. A UE decides which resource allocation scheme(s) can be used in the AS based on its capability (for a UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/OOC) and the allowed resource schemes in the resource pool configuration. Random resource selection is applicable to both periodic and aperiodic traffic.\nA UE configured for partial sensing can perform periodic-based partial sensing and/or contiguous partial sensing for resource (re)selection. Periodic-based partial sensing can only be performed in a TX pool configured with partial sensing and periodic resource reservation. In periodic-based partial sensing, the UE monitors slots in periodic sensing occasion(s) for a given resource reservation periodicity. Contiguous partial sensing is performed by a UE configured for partial sensing when resource (re)selection is triggered by the UE in a TX pool configured with partial sensing. In contiguous partial sensing, the UE monitors slots in a contiguous sensing window which occur prior to the selected transmission resource. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of IUC in NR Sidelink enhancement?

With the quick migration from 2G/3G to LTE and the increasing marketing requirement for high-quality voice/video services, voice and video over LTE has being deployed and launched by operators over the world, which makes voice and video over LTE capability extremely important for operators [1]. For this reason, to improve voice/video coverage performance, PUSCH enhancement mode is introduced involving the following main components in RAN1.\nThe main purpose of the eVoLTE CE technologies is to reuse as much as possible the existing CE technologies in eMTC CE mode A, while keeping independent of eMTC \"CE mode A\" capability.\n3GPP\nRelease 14\t45\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)\n\nVoLTE quality/coverage enhancement:\nVoLTE coverage can be effectively enhanced by relaxing the air interface delay budget. UE uses RRC signalling to report the delay budget information. Based on the reported delay budget information, when a UE is in good coverage, the eNB can configure longer DRX for power saving purpose or the eNB can reduce DRX cycle in order to help peer side; when the UE is in bad coverage, the eNB can increase the retransmission times in order to reduce the packet loss.\nSA4 specific aspects:\nThis summary reports on the normative specification progress accomplished during the course of the\nLTE_VoLTE_ViLTE_enh-S4 work item [1]. This is the SA4 building block of the LTE_VoLTE_ViLTE_enh feature, where the core feature LTE_VoLTE_ViLTE_enh-Core [2] has been specified by RAN2. The WI summary for the core part has already been submitted to RAN plenary in March 2017, and can be found in RP-170323 [3].\nMedia handling aspects of RAN-assisted codec adaptation in MTSI were specified in TS 26.114 including the following aspects: (i) Adaptation requirements, recommendations and guidelines for speech and video adaptation mechanisms, in response to the availability of RAN-recommended UL/DL bitrate information at the MTSI client (on both MTSI sender and receiver sides), including impacts on adaptation triggers, sender behaviors and receiver behaviors, (ii) Utilization of RAN-recommended UL/DL bitrate information in generation of RTCP-APP or RTP CMR messages for speech rate adaptation, (iii) Utilization of RAN-recommended UL/DL bitrate information in generation of RTCP feedback (e.g., TMMBR, TMMBN messages of CCM, etc.) messages for video rate adaptation. (iv) Use with dynamic bitrate adaptation, including adaptation of sent and received media utilizing RAN-recommended UL/DL information and recommended bitrate query messages, (v) Impact of availability of RAN-recommended UL/DL bitrate information on SDP offer/answer session re-negotiation procedures in MTSI. The support of this feature for MTSI was specified based on a more generalized \"access network bitrate recommendation\" (ANBR) framework to allow for usage for both LTE access and non-LTE access, while also establishing the clear connections to LTE access and associated mappings between ANBR messages and RAN-specified MAC level messages for LTE access.

The main functionalities introduced here are the support of redundant transmission, QoS monitoring, dynamic division of the Packet Delay Budget, and enhancements of the session continuity mechanism.\nRedundant transmission for high-reliability communication\nSome URLLC services request very high reliability that hardly can be supported in an economical way by a single transport path. To support such services, a redundant transmission mechanism is specified. User packets are duplicated and simultaneously transferred to the receiver via two disjoint user plane paths. The redundant packets are then eliminated at the receiver side. With this, service failure can be avoided even in case the packet transmission via one path occasionally fails or exceeds the delay requirement. \nDifferent options are specified to support redundant transmission at different layers (figures extracted from 23.501):\n\n6.23\tQoS monitoring \n6.23.1\tDescription \nThe QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC services, vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate QoS guarantees from the network. However, the network cannot always guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that the application and/or application server is notified in a timely manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.\nFor more information on QoS assurance see Annex F. \nVertical automation systems are locally distributed and are typically served by wired and wireless communication networks of different types and with different characteristics. If the operation of the system or one of its sub-processes does not work properly, there is a need for quickly finding and eliminating the related error or fault in order to avoid significant operation and thus financial losses. To that end, automation devices and applications implement diagnosis and error-analysis algorithms, as well as predictive maintenance features.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of QoS Monitoring in the enhancement of URLLC support in the 5G Core network?

With traditional earpiece designs, the perceived loudness comes from acoustic radiation into the ear canal. With non-traditional earpieces, such as vibrating displays, sound may be transmitted to the user by other mechanisms (e.g. tissue conduction). Because HATS primarily measure acoustic radiation through the ear canal, one question is whether HATS is suitable for measurement of handsets featuring non-traditional earpieces.\nTo compare objective and subjective assessments of loudness on devices featuring a traditional and non-traditional earpiece (vibrating display), an experimental methodology was developed by the source.\n4.2.1.2\tDescription of experimental apparatus\n4.2.1.2.1\tTraditional and Non-Traditional Earpiece prototypes\nTwo handset prototypes were developed for this experiment. Prototype 1 incorporates a 27ohm 15x6 mm earpiece (traditional earpiece) radiating sound through an acoustic port on the display, and Prototype 2 incorporates an 8ohm 15x6mm actuator directly attached to the prototype display. Apart from this difference, both prototypes are identical. See Figure 4-3.

Segmentation applies to both NR and E-UTRA and is captured respectively in [11] and [12].\n\nSegmentation is performed in the RRC protocol layer, with a separate RRC PDU for each segment. The UE encodes the capability information message, then divides the encoded message into segments such that the size of each segment does not exceed the maximum size of a PDCP SDU (8188 octets in E-UTRA, 9000 octets in NR); the RAN node (eNB or gNB) receives the segments and reassembles them to reconstruct the original capability information message. Segmentation is applied only in case the size of the encoded capability information message exceeds the maximum size of a PDCP SDU. The signalling formats support up to 16 segments for a single capability information message.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in: \nhttps://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=840054,800025,830027,840003,840055,840056,840057,830079,800097,830179 \n[1]\tSP-180599, \u201cStudy on optimisations on UE radio capability signaling\u201d\n[2] \tTR 23.743, \u201cStudy on optimisations on UE radio capability signaling\u201d\n[3]\tTS\u00a023.501, \u201cSystem architecture for the 5G System (5GS)\u201d\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which 3GPP specification captures the segmentation mechanism for NR?

AULC extends this PRA mechanism by allowing multiple PRAs per IP-CAN session, while maintaing the reduced CN load gained by CNO-ULI. Moreover, it provides a mechanism to avoid an MME overload in case of too many PRA monitoring subscriptions.\nFinally, AULC offers to decouple the subscription between the PCRF and the Online Charging System (OCS), which means that the PCRF and the OCS can subscribe multiple PRAs reporting separately.\nThree kinds of PRAs have been defined, which can be mixed:\nUE dedicated PRA: those PRAs information are provisioned by the PCRF/OCS to the MME each time the IP-CAN session is established.

This work item enhances the existing ICS capabilities and introduces two new functional entities to the network that enable all the services of a subscriber to be supported by only the IMS service domain. The new functional entities that are introduced are a MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC and a ICS interworking function (ICS IWF).\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which standard provides the specification for interworking between the IMS domain and the CS domain?

The solutions that have been specified include:\n-\tSemi-static CFI configuration\n-\tPDSCH repetition\n-\tUL SPS repetition\n-\tPDCP packet duplication\n-\tGranular time reference provision.\nThese solutions support configurable reliability and latency combinations and have been specified on top of the existing LTE air interface for Frame Structure type 1 (FS1) and Frame Structure type 2 (FS2), including various LTE TTI lengths (1ms, slot and subslot for FS1, 1ms and slot for FS2) as well as existing LTE latency reduction techniques.\nAn overview of the specified solutions is provided in the following.\nSemi-static CFI\nControl Format Indicator (CFI) indicates how many OFDM symbols are used for the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.\n\n-\tCritical Communications (CC) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC): Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very high communications service availability. These are driven by the new services such as industrial automation. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a server which may be outside the 5G system, and data processing. Some of these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections between the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for example, to allow local hosting of the services. The scenarios and their performance requirements can be found in table 7.2.2-1 of TS\u00a022.261\u00a0[1]. For instance, in the context of remote control for process automation, a reliability of 99,9999% is expected, with a user experienced data rate up to 100 Mbps and an end-to-end latency of 50 ms.

We also note that matrices G and W are unitary, which allows direct comparison of the terms in (GW-a.k3.I);  the relative magnitude of | a.k3| is small enough that matrix B would still be dominated by the first term (GW \uf053xxH) for the range of EVMs expected to be measured. We therefore expect B is rank 2 for pseudo random data. Consequently, here too, rank of \uf053yxH depends solely on rank of H. i.e \uf053yxH is rank 2 (i.e it is invertible) if H is also rank 2. If F is still not invertible (i.e \uf053yxH is rank 1), it is because the UE cannot support an OTA channel (H) of rank2, and is unable to maintain valid 2L UL.\nThis treatment can conclude with the observation that both F and F-1 exist provided the UE can support a rank 2 OTA channel, i.e rank(H)=2.\n5.2.3.1.2.6\tMethod 2 DC (LO) cancellation\nEVM calculation is gated by the TE\u2019s procedure to cancel LO. Per existing signaling, only one LO location can be declared per BWP for the carrier being tested, be it single layer or two.

For NR, LO cancellation based on signaling declaration of LO location can therefore be performed either pre- or post-FFT.

S8HR is an architecture for IMS voice roaming where, even though the UE is roaming in a VPLMN, all the following entities are located in the HPLMN: PGW, PCRF, ATCF, ATGW, P-CSCF, S-CSCF and TAS.\nOne of the main implications is that the S8HR roaming architecture is not using the Local Breakout anymore and, therefore, the IMS APN is resolved to point to a PGW in the HPLMN. So the IMS NNI between Home and Visited PLMN for VoLTE roaming will be different whether the S8HR architecture is used or not.\n3GPP\nRelease 14\t42\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)\nThe standardization of VoLTE roaming with S8HR architecture impacts several areas, and was then handled by a number of 3GPP groups:\nArchitectural aspects (SA2 Work Item \"V8\"). This covers three main topics:\nEmergency call: For Local breakout roaming architecture, the home and visited PLMN connect via the IMS NNI. The connection will provide all essential information to establish emergency call.
