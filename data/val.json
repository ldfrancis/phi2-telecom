As an example, a WLAN access network may utilize EAP re-authentication in order to enable Fast Initial Link Setup (specified in IEEE 802.11ai) and minimize the link-setup delay between the UE and the WLAN access network.\nAn EPC network may optionally support EAP re-authentication for interworking with non-3GPP accesses. Also, the UE may optionally support EAP re-authentication. By using EAP re-authentication, UEs can connect to EPC via non-3GPP access and utilize EPC services with enhanced performance. For example, a UE may experience improved voice-over-IMS service due to the small link-setup delay that occurs when the UE transitions between access points in the non-3GPP access network.\nWhen an EPC network supports EAP re-authentication, the functionality of the 3GPP AAA server/proxy and the procedures over STa, SWa and SWd interfaces shall be enhanced in order to support the applicable procedures specified in RFC\u00a06696\u00a0[85].

It is independent on the EAP method in use but it permits a re-authentication based on key material (unexpired) derived from a previous authentication. As for the Fast re-authentication method (clause 6.3), it re-uses the key derived from the previous full authentication. It does not involve the HSS, nor the credentials used by EAP-AKA' and does not involve the handling of EAP-AKA' authentication vectors, which makes the procedure faster and reduces the load on (the 3GPP AAA server and) the HSS and, in particular the Authentication Centre. \nThe ERP protocol permits to perform the re-authentication process at the 3GPP AAA Server avoiding signalling on SWx. It also permits to delegate the re-authentication process to the TWAP (Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy) avoiding signalling on STa (and SWd in case of roaming) or to the 3GPP AAA Proxy avoiding signalling on SWd, thus reducing the load as well on the 3GPP AAA server. \nTo use ERP, the basic assumption is that ERP is supported by the WLAN. For non-roaming scenarios, the ER server (as described in IETF RFC 6696[x]) may reside in the TWAP or the 3GPP AAA server. In roaming scenarios, there is an additional case where the ER server resides within the 3GPP AAA Proxy.\n", "11.1.2\tSupport of EAP Re-authentication Protocol for WLAN Interworking\nSummary based on the input provided by Orange in SP-17XXXX.\n3GPP\nThe procedures for access to 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via non-3GPP access networks have been enhanced in Rel-14 to enable an EPC network to optionally support the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP). ERP allows efficient re-authentication between the UE and a dedicated server that can be located in the TWAP or the 3GPP AAA proxy/server and provides optimized link-setup delay after handover between access points.\nThe Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) (IETF RFC 6696 [1]) is used for authentication of user accessing EPC using non-3GPP access networks. To avoid full EAP authentication when moving from one access point to another one of the same access network, ERP has been defined to ensure efficient re-authentication between the UE and an EAP re-authentication server through any access point.\nIn SA2, TS 23.402, which specifies the procedures for access to EPC via non-3GPP access networks, has been enhanced in Rel-14 to enable an EPC network to optionally support ERP. By using ERP, UEs can connect to EPC via trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access and utilize EPC services with enhanced performances provided by an optimized link-setup delay after handover between access points.\n"]}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the Early data transmission feature in NB-IoT?

They also miss some updates from IETF RFCs regarding IPv6 and DHCPv6 support. \nThere are three new specifications for PnC are created as result of this work item. They are the full set of specifications covering stage 1 (TS 28.314), stage 2 (TS 28.315), and stage 3 (TS 28.316) of PnC. The new specifications added support of IPv6, DHCPv6 and dual stack for PnC and extended the PnC to support SBMA. The restriction to PnC on eNB was removed, the scope of the PnC is extended to support network element (NE) including LTE and NR radio network nodes. Other types of nodes might also be compliant and use this PnC procedure. The same level of security support as for eNB is provided in the new specifications for NE.\n", "6.1.1\tUse cases\n6.1.1.1\tUse case #1a: Network access control\nRelying on PLMN network, PNI-NPN provides logically independent 5G non-public network for vertical industry customers through network slice instances/ dedicated DNNs, and supporting of CAG feature.

In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.\n", "-\tSemistatic CFI: A semistatic value for CFI (which determines the number of symbols to be used for PDCCH in a given subframe) is indicated in MIB.

During the congestion period, the continuous less importance data from the UPF to the RAN may cause the RAN more congested and waste the transport layer resource between the RAN and the UPF. The UPF can also drop some less important data to the RAN when RAN is congested. Besides, the existing FAR has supported to block or buffer chose data at the UPF.\nHence, the solution proposes to make UPF not to transmit the less important DL data to the RAN when the RAN congestion happens.\nBesides, in some XRM service, P frame and B frame are also important as I frame to construct the fluent video, dropping of those P frame and B frame causes jitter to the QoE which is not better than giving up the whole service. In some other XRM service, P frame and B frame are used to enhance the high definition, e.g. from 720p to 1080p. dropping of those P frame and B frame makes sense to keep the service when the network resource cannot transmit all of the service data.\n", "5.4.1\tDescription\nIn current 5GS, the QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in the PDU Session. The 5G QoS characteristics is determined by the 5QI. This implies that each packet in a QoS flow is treated according to the same QoS requirements.\nFor XR/media services, a group of packets are used to carry payloads of a PDU Set (e.g. a frame, video slice/tile).\nIn media layer, packets in such a PDU Set are decoded/handled as a whole. For example, the frame/video slice may only be decoded in case all or certain amount of the packets carrying the frame/video slice are successfully delivered. For example, a frame within a GOP (Group of Pictures) can only be decoded by the client in case all frames on which that frame depends are successfully received. Hence the groups of packets within the PDU Set have inherent dependency on each other in media layer. Without considering such dependencies between the packets within the PDU set, 5GS may perform a scheduling with low efficiency. For example, the 5GS may randomly drop packet (s) but try to deliver other packets of the same PDU set which are useless to the client and thus waste radio resources.\n"]}, {"question": "What does a UE do with a BWP inactivity timer for a cell when the timer is running?

In session based charging, at least two chargeable events are needed, one each to describe the start and the end of the session, respectively. Multiple interim events are possible in order to describe changes of session characteristics (e.g. change of IP CAN bearer QoS or change of IMS session media types), or when certain limits, e.g. time or volume, are exceeded.

The re-attempts continue to fail until UE enters the coverage and respond to the paging attempts. This repetitive paging attempts result in the wastage of network resources. As an example, the use case includes a user or a group of users getting into an area, with no cellular coverage on a regular basis for a considerably long duration, for e.g. the user gets into a shielded room for some testing purpose every day for a defined period. The Network initiated paging for such users will fail until they are back in the area with cellular coverage. This would result in in-efficient network resource usage.\nIt is desirable to use MDAS (Management data analytic service) to optimize the current paging procedures in 5G networks. MDAS producer provides an analytics output containing the user(s) paging analytics indicating the time window at which a group of users are OOC on a regular basis at the particular location. MDAS producer also provides the geographical map within which the UEs would experience paging issues and hence will not be able to respond on a network-initiated paging. Based on the provided MDA output, MDAS consumer (e.g.\u00a0AMF, gNB) decides on whether, when and where to initiate or not to initiate the paging procedures, thereby ensuring the efficient paging procedures and optimal network resource utilization, as paging can be initiated only when there are more chances for it to be successful.\n"]}, {"question": "What does MPS prioritize in the PS domain when the network does not support the requested service?

In such architecture, PAs directly interact with the antenna array due to low path isolation between them. As a result, mutual coupling and antenna mismatch between antenna paths have strong impact to the PAs\u2019 output matching impedance which changes the PA\u2019s efficiency and nonlinearity behaviours [5]. The array steering angle, which also alters the antenna matching impedance, shows strong dependence on the nonlinearity to the PAs too. In addition, input of PAs in different branches may be driven with different power as a result of the beamforming techniques applied (i.e. tapering, ZF, etc.), or gain error of the phase shifters and gain imbalance of power division network [6]. These mentioned factors have the detrimental effect to efficiency and linearity behaviours of PAs which may degrade the ACLR while increasing the OOB emission and beam distortions [5].

To support such services, a redundant transmission mechanism is specified. User packets are duplicated and simultaneously transferred to the receiver via two disjoint user plane paths. The redundant packets are then eliminated at the receiver side. With this, service failure can be avoided even in case the packet transmission via one path occasionally fails or exceeds the delay requirement. \nDifferent options are specified to support redundant transmission at different layers (figures extracted from 23.501):\n", "6.23\tQoS monitoring \n6.23.1\tDescription \nThe QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC services, vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate QoS guarantees from the network. However, the network cannot always guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that the application and/or application server is notified in a timely manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.\nFor more information on QoS assurance see Annex F. \nVertical automation systems are locally distributed and are typically served by wired and wireless communication networks of different types and with different characteristics. If the operation of the system or one of its sub-processes does not work properly, there is a need for quickly finding and eliminating the related error or fault in order to avoid significant operation and thus financial losses. To that end, automation devices and applications implement diagnosis and error-analysis algorithms, as well as predictive maintenance features.\n", "4.4.1\tDescription\nURLLC is one of the typical 5G services.

In unpaired spectrum, DL and UL switch BWP simultaneously. Switching between configured BWPs happens by means of RRC signalling, DCI, inactivity timer or upon initiation of random access. When an inactivity timer is configured for a serving cell, the expiry of the inactivity timer associated to that cell switches the active BWP to a default BWP configured by the network.

However, the network cannot always guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that the application and/or application server is notified in a timely manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.\nFor more information on QoS assurance see Annex F. \nVertical automation systems are locally distributed and are typically served by wired and wireless communication networks of different types and with different characteristics. If the operation of the system or one of its sub-processes does not work properly, there is a need for quickly finding and eliminating the related error or fault in order to avoid significant operation and thus financial losses. To that end, automation devices and applications implement diagnosis and error-analysis algorithms, as well as predictive maintenance features.\n", "Due to their inherent challenges, wireless communication systems are usually under suspicion in case an error occurs in a distributed automation application. Therefore, diagnosis and fault analysis features for 5G systems are required. The 5G system needs to provide sufficient monitoring information as input for such diagnosis features.\nQoS monitoring can be used for the following activities: \n-\tassessing and assuring the dependability of network operation;\n-\tassessing and assuring the dependability of the communication services;\n-\texcluding particular communication errors;\n-\tidentifying communication errors;\n-\tanalysing the location of an error including the geographic location of the involved network component (UE; front-haul component; core node);\n-\tactivation of application-related countermeasures.\nThis section provides requirements for both functionality and service exposure.

VRUP provides warning to vehicles of the presence of vulnerable road users, e.g. pedestrian or cyclist, in case of dangerous situation. In VRUP, multiple V2X messages need to be exchanged between the pedestrian and the vehicular UEs, originating by one or more applications. Such messages can be standard VRU messages (e.g. VAM) and other V2X messages (CAM, DENM, BSM, CPM) and can be exchanged via different transmission modes (unicast, groupcast, broadcast).\nIn such scenario, one challenge is that a pedestrian UE might have a lower battery capacity and limited radio capability, and therefore may have to work in a low power consumption mode, e.g. not being able to send/receive V2X messages with the same periodicity as a Vehicular UE. Continuous sending/receiving V2X messages by the pedestrian UE would affect UE power efficiency. A further challenge is that multiple applications related to VRU may be deployed, which may have differentiated traffic/QoS requirements as well as transmission/reception schedules. \n"]}, {"question": "What does the Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify service operation do?

A notification is a message that contains information about the event.\nService consumer NFs (clients) need to subscribe to notifications at the service provider NF (server).

It is up to the API to define the resources that support subscriptions.\nWhen the change/event occurs at the service producer NF, notifications (see clause\u00a04.6.2.3) are sent from the service producer NF to the service consumer NFs.

One of the key V2P applications is the Vulnerable Road User Protection (VRUP) as specified in ETSI\u00a0TS\u00a0103 300-2\u00a0[13]. VRUP provides warning to vehicles of the presence of vulnerable road users, e.g. pedestrian or cyclist, in case of dangerous situation. In VRUP, multiple V2X messages need to be exchanged between the pedestrian and the vehicular UEs, originating by one or more applications. Such messages can be standard VRU messages (e.g. VAM) and other V2X messages (CAM, DENM, BSM, CPM) and can be exchanged via different transmission modes (unicast, groupcast, broadcast).\nIn such scenario, one challenge is that a pedestrian UE might have a lower battery capacity and limited radio capability, and therefore may have to work in a low power consumption mode, e.g. not being able to send/receive V2X messages with the same periodicity as a Vehicular UE. Continuous sending/receiving V2X messages by the pedestrian UE would affect UE power efficiency.
