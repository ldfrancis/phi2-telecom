This involves providing priority treatment for the signalling during the UE attachment for radio access and network connectivity based on a subscription profile. Prior to accessing subscription related information in the network, subscription related information stored in the UE is used, e.g., membership in the special access class required to be reserved for MPS use as per 3GPP TS 22.011 [6], or the special Access Identity used for MPS as per 3GPP TS 22.261 [7]. Without such priority treatment, a Service User\u2019s UE might fail to gain radio access network and CN connectivity which in turn means that there is no access to the MPS application services (Voice, Video, and Data). Priority treatment before MPS session request increases the probability of successful MPS session establishment and any associated process for the Service User authorization (e.g., credential collection). \n\n5.6\tInvocation on demand\nMPS priority shall be invoked only when requested by the Service User.

This feature is useful for smart phone services to improve resource utilization and latency of state transition between CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH.\nConsidering the increasing number of users and the amount of traffic for small data applications, the UE will be in CELL_FACH state more often, and the introduction of HS-SCCH DRX is a way to save UE battery life.\nWith this functionality, the UTRAN indicates an inactivity time, a HS-SCCH DRX cycle length and a HS-SCCH RX burst length. This information is stored by the UE for use when in CELL_FACH state. If HS-SCCH DRX is configured through dedicated RRC signalling, the UE has to follow HS-SCCH DRX operation in CELL_FACH state.\n\n15.4.2.3\tCell DTX/DRX\nTo facilitate reducing gNB downlink transmission/uplink reception active time, UE can be configured with a periodic cell DTX/DRX pattern (i.e. active and non-active periods). The pattern configuration for cell DTX/DRX is common for the UEs configured with this feature in the cell. The cell DTX and cell DRX patterns can be configured and activated separately. A maximum of two cell DTX/DRX patterns can be configured per MAC entity for different serving cells.

Segmentation applies to both NR and E-UTRA and is captured respectively in [11] and [12].\n\nSegmentation is performed in the RRC protocol layer, with a separate RRC PDU for each segment. The UE encodes the capability information message, then divides the encoded message into segments such that the size of each segment does not exceed the maximum size of a PDCP SDU (8188 octets in E-UTRA, 9000 octets in NR); the RAN node (eNB or gNB) receives the segments and reassembles them to reconstruct the original capability information message. Segmentation is applied only in case the size of the encoded capability information message exceeds the maximum size of a PDCP SDU.

The S1 and X2 proxy functionality includes passing UE-dedicated S1 and X2 signalling messages as well as GTP data packets between the S1 and X2 interfaces associated with the RN and the S1 and X2 interfaces associated with other network nodes. Due to the proxy functionality, the DeNB appears as an MME (for S1-MME), an eNB (for X2) and an S-GW (for S1-U) to the RN.\nIn phase II of RN operation (see clause 4.7.6.3), the DeNB also embeds and provides the S-GW/P-GW-like functions needed for the RN operation. This includes creating a session for the RN and managing EPS bearers for the RN, as well as terminating the S11 interface towards the MME serving the RN.\nThe RN and DeNB also perform mapping of signalling and data packets onto EPS bearers that are setup for the RN.

This includes aspects like closed-loop control applications (e.g., based on programmable logic or motion controllers) and robotics, as well as aspects of computer-integrated manufacturing. Factory automation generally represents a key enabler for industrial mass production with high quality and cost-efficiency. Corresponding applications are often characterised by highest requirements on the underlying communication infrastructure, especially in terms of communication service availability, determinism, and latency. In the Factories of the Future, static sequential production systems will be more and more replaced by novel modular production systems offering a high flexibility and versatility. This involves many increasingly mobile production assets, for which powerful wireless communication and localisation services are required. \n2)\tProcess automation: Process automation refers to the control of production and handling of substances like chemicals, food & beverage, pulp, etc. Process automation improves the efficiency of production processes, energy consumption, and safety of the facilities. Sensors measuring process values, such as pressures or temperatures, are working in closed loops via centralised and decentralised controllers. In turn, the controllers interact with actuators, e.g., valves, pumps, heaters. Also, monitoring of attributes such as the filling levels of tanks, quality of material, or environmental data are important, as well as safety warnings or plant shut downs. Workers in the plant are supported by mobile devices. A process automation facility may range from a few 100\u00a0m\u00b2 to several km\u00b2, and the facility may be geographically distributed. Depending on the size, a production plant may have several 10,000 measurement points and actuators. Autarkic device power supply for years is needed in order to stay flexible and to keep the total costs of ownership low. \n\n4.2\tActivity patterns in automation\nOpen-loop control: The salient aspect of open-loop control is the lack of feedback from the output to the control; when providing commands to an actuator, it is assumed that the output of the influenced process is predetermined and within an acceptable range. This kind of control loop works if the influences of the environment on process and actuator are negligible. Also, this kind of control is applied in case unwanted output can be tolerated [8]. \nClosed-loop control: Closed-loop control enables the manipulation of processes even if the environment influences the process or the performance of the actuator changes over time. This type of control is realised by sensing the process output and by feeding these measurements back into a controller [8]. \nSequence control: Sequence control may either step through a fixed sequence or employ logic that performs different actions based on various system states and system input [8]. Sequence control can be seen as an extension of both open-loop and closed-loop control, but instead of achieving only one output instance, an entire sequence of output instances can be produced [9]. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What are the considerations for closed-loop factory automation?

Open-loop control is characterised by one or many messages sent to an actuator. These can be sent in a periodic or an aperiodic pattern. However, the communication means used need to be deterministic since typically an activity response from the receiver and/or the receiving application is expected. \nClosed-loop control produces both periodic and aperiodic communication patterns. Closed-loop control is often used for the control of continuous processes with tight time-control limits, e.g., the control of a printing press. In this case, one typically relies on periodic communication patterns. Note that in both the aperiodic and periodic case, the communication needs to be deterministic. \nLogging of device states, measurements, etc. for maintenance purposes and such typically entails aperiodic communication patterns.

LTE radio network dimensioning is typically optimized for data services. To avoid negative impacts on user experience for VoLTE subscribers in areas with weak LTE coverage, a handover to 2G or 3G is performed sooner, i.e. at a higher RSRP level, for UEs with established voice bearers compared to UEs with only data bearers.\nAs in the Technical Specification for Multimedia Telephony Service over IMS (MTSI), TS 26.114, which is used as basis for the GSMA IR.92 VoLTE profile, there have been several tools for increased robustness of speech calls with initial selection of Codecs and their Configuration and in-call dynamic rate and mode adaptation and application layer redundancy.

S8HR is an architecture for IMS voice roaming where, even though the UE is roaming in a VPLMN, all the following entities are located in the HPLMN: PGW, PCRF, ATCF, ATGW, P-CSCF, S-CSCF and TAS.\nOne of the main implications is that the S8HR roaming architecture is not using the Local Breakout anymore and, therefore, the IMS APN is resolved to point to a PGW in the HPLMN. So the IMS NNI between Home and Visited PLMN for VoLTE roaming will be different whether the S8HR architecture is used or not.\n3GPP\nRelease 14\t42\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)\nThe standardization of VoLTE roaming with S8HR architecture impacts several areas, and was then handled by a number of 3GPP groups:\nArchitectural aspects (SA2 Work Item \"V8\").

In LAA, the configured set of serving cells for a UE therefore always includes at least one SCell operating in the unlicensed spectrum according to Frame structure Type 3, also called LAA SCell. Unless otherwise specified, LAA SCells act as regular SCells.\nLAA eNB and UE apply Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) before performing a transmission on LAA SCell. When LBT is applied, the transmitter listens to/senses the channel to determine whether the channel is free or busy. If the channel is determined to be free, the transmitter may perform the transmission; otherwise, it does not perform the transmission. If an LAA eNB uses channel access signals of other technologies for the purpose of LAA channel access, it shall continue to meet the LAA maximum energy detection threshold requirement.\nThe combined time of transmissions compliant with the channel access procedure described in clause 4.1.2 of TS 37.213 [90] by an eNB should not exceed 50 ms in any contiguous 1 second period on an LAA SCell.\n\n5.6.1\tOverview\nNR Radio Access operating with shared spectrum channel access can operate in different modes where either PCell, PSCell, or SCells can be in shared spectrum and an SCell may or may not be configured with uplink. The applicable deployment scenarios are described in Annex B.3.\nThe gNB performs channel access mode procedures as described in TS 37.213 [37]. The gNB and the UE may apply Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) before performing a transmission on a cell configured with shared spectrum channel access. When LBT is applied, the transmitter listens to/senses the channel to determine whether the channel is free or busy and performs transmission only if the channel is sensed free.\nWhen the UE detects consistent uplink LBT failures, it takes actions as specified in TS 38.321 [6]. The detection is per Bandwidth Part (BWP) and based on all uplink transmissions within this BWP. When consistent uplink LBT failures are detected on SCell(s), the UE reports this to the corresponding gNB (MN for MCG, SN for SCG) via MAC CE on a different serving cell than the SCell(s) where the failures were detected. If no resources are available to transmit the MAC CE, a Scheduling Request (SR) can be transmitted by the UE. When consistent uplink LBT failures are detected on SpCell, the UE switches to another UL BWP with configured RACH resources on that cell, initiates RACH, and reports the failure via MAC CE. When multiple UL BWPs are available for switching, it is up to the UE implementation which one to select. For PSCell, if consistent uplink LBT failures are detected on all the UL BWPs with configured RACH resources, the UE declares SCG RLF and reports the failure to the MN via SCGFailureInformation.

In general the accuracy of the location depends on the positioning technology used, the varying radio environments (e.g. considering multipath propagation), the type of environment where the location is measured (dense urban area or rural area).\nThe location accuracy required by each service varies and can vary from location accuracy up to 200km for weather services to location accuracy of up to 50m for Asset Location, route guidance, navigation. Further information is provided in Table 4.1 of TS\u00a022.071\u00a0[18].\nWhen a location client requires a location accuracy the location client may include in the request to the GMLC:\n-\tA response time (no delay, low delay, delay tolerant).\n-\tHorizontal and/or vertical accuracy requirements (in meters).\n\n4.7\tKey issue\u00a0#7: Support for location accuracy analytics \nAccording to SA1 TS 22.261 (6.27) and TS 22.104, positioning services aim to support verticals and applications with positioning accuracies better than 10 meters, thus more accurate than the ones of TS 22.071 for LCS. High accuracy positioning is characterized by ambitious system requirements for positioning accuracy in many verticals and applications, including regulatory needs. For example, on the factory floor, it is important to locate assets and moving objects such as forklifts, or parts to be assembled. Similar needs exist in transportation and logistics, for example rail, road and use of UAVs. In some road user cases, UE's supporting V2X application(s) are also applicable to such needs. In cases such as guided vehicles (e.g. industry, UAVs) and positioning of objects involved in safety-related functions, availability needs to be very high. In SA1, different service levels are mapped to different positioning performance attributes including vertical and horizontal accuracies. Such accuracies (e.g. cm-level, dm-level, meter-level) may depend on the positioning methods which are used, the LCS producers, as well as the UE mobility and the environment. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What factors can affect the accuracy of location services?

It also connects to the UE via the NR interface, not shown on the figure.

In order to meet the latency requirement for V2X message delivery, the following standardized QCI (QoS Class Identifier) values defined in TS 23.203 [3] can be used:\n\nQCI 3 (GBR bearer) and QCI 79 (Non-GBR bearer) can be used for the unicast delivery of V2X messages.\n3GPP\nRelease 14\t24\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)\nQCI 75 (GBR bearer) is only used for the delivery of V2X messages over MBMS bearers.\nSecurity aspects\nThe Work Item on \"Security aspect of LTE support of V2X services (V2XLTE-Sec)\", driven by SA WG3, specifies the security aspects for LTE based V2X communication in TS 33.185 [4], including security architecture, security requirements, as well as procedures and solutions to meet those requirements.\nOverall, security mechanisms from TS 33.303 [5] and TS 33.401 [6], initially designed for ProSe (Proximity-based Services) and LTE respectively are applicable to security support of V2X services, since V2X architecture is based on those architectures. The V3 interface between the UE and the V2X Control Function can be secured in the same way as the PC3 interface between the UE and the ProSe Function, as in TS 33.303 [5]; PSK TLS with GBA (Pre-shared Key Transport Layer Security with Generic Bootstrapping Architecture) is used for UE initiated messages, while PSK TLS including option of GBA push are used for network initiated messages.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What standardized QCI values can be used for unicast delivery of V2X messages over LTE-Uu?

With the MARCOM feature, the work on maritime communication services is officially included in the scope of 3GPP standardization so 3GPP enabling technologies can be applicable to for maritime usage from 3GPP Release 16 onwards.\nThe first 3GPP Technical Specification (TS) 22.119 [1] covering service requirements (Stage 1) is specified for the support of maritime communication (MARCOM) over 3GPP systems.\nThe maritime domain, one of the 5G vertical domains in 3GPP, is moving forward with the digitalisation and mobilisation of commercial as well as safety fields. Legacy 3GPP-based technologies and solutions can be beneficial to the digitalisation and mobilisation of the maritime domain though some of the legacy 3GPP enabling technologies and solutions may not be able to fully support the performances required by the maritime domain. The maritime radio environment was not originally considered by 3GPP when the technical specifications and solutions were standardised for LTE and 5G. \n\nHowever, most of the legacy mobile services and IoT services based on capabilities of EPS and 5GS specified in 3GPP specifications are applicable to maritime usage for the support of mobile broadband services, and for the support of IoT services or machine-type communication services in a vessel at sea. \nIn addition, there are service scenarios and requirements specified in 3GPP specifications based on requirements of other related vertical domains (e.g. public safety domain, automotive domain, factory automation domain, and satellite industrial domain). Some requirements derived by service scenarios from these related vertical domains are applicable to the maritime domain. Thus, it is beneficial to use 3GPP enabling technologies developed to satisfy those requirements for the maritime domain in terms of the economy of scale.\nFor example, satellite access is one of the 3GPP radio access networks supported over the 5G system, so it is possible to provide seamless maritime mobile services by integrating multiple access technologies including satellite access depending on the service scenarios. In addition, Vertical LAN that can replace Ethernet-based access are applicable to indoor maritime mobile services inside a vessel.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which 3GPP Technical Specification covers the service requirements for maritime communication over 5G systems?

If the Direct-Debiting-Failure-Handling AVP is not used, the locally configured values are used instead.\n5.3.2.1.2.1\tReception of SIP error messages\nIf SIP errors in SIP response (4xx, 5xx or 6xx) occur during service delivery, as defined in TS 24.228 [202] and TS 23.218 [203], it is up to the IMS Network Element to determine to what extent the service was delivered before the error occurred and act appropriately with respect to charging. This may imply that no units at all (or no more units) are debited.\n5.3.2.1.2.2\tDebit Units operation failure\nThis case comprises situations where either no, or an erroneous response, is received from the OCS. The \"no response\" case is detected by the IMS Network Element when the connection supervision timer Tx expires (IETF RFC 4006 [402]) before a Debit / Reserve Units Response is received.  The case of receiving an erroneous response implies that the IMS Network Element receives a Debit / Reserve Units Response, which it is unable to process, while Tx is running. The failure handling complies with the failure procedures for \"Direct Debiting\" scenario described in IETF RFC 4006 [402].\n\n- \tDirect Debiting: the requested resource can be determined and billed in a one-off procedure. In that case, the resource usage is debited from the subscriber account immediately when processing the charging event, and the permission for the resource usage is returned to the network. An example of this may be the forwarding of a terminating short message from the MSC to the end user. In this scenario, it is generally required that the network can guarantee resource usage execution in order to avoid over-billing the user.\n- \tUnit Reservation: the OCS/CCS cannot a priori know the amount of resources that the end user may eventually consume, or it cannot be assumed a priori that the resource usage request can be (completely) fulfilled. In this case, a certain amount of (monetary or non-monetary) units is blocked, or reserved, on the subscriber\u2019s account on the OCS/CCS, and permission to use an amount of resources that matches the unit reservation is returned to the network. When the granted units have been used or a new, not yet authorised chargeable event occurs, the network must send a new request for unit allocation to the OCS/CCS. When resource usage has been executed, the actual amount of resource usage (i.e. the used units) must be returned by the NE/NF to the OCS/CCS so that eventually over-reserved amounts can be re-credited to the subscriber account, assuring that the correct amount gets debited.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What happens during a direct debiting process?

This concept is used because in general PSCCH/PSSCH cannot be transmitted (and thus are not expected to be received) in all PRBs and subframes in the system bandwidth, nor within a given frequency span configured for V2X sidelink. The notion of a resource pool also reflects, in resource allocation mode 4, that a UE will make its resource selections based on sensing within the (PSSCH) pool.\nFor PSSCH, a resource pool is divided into sub-channels in the frequency domain, which are consecutively non-overlapping sets of \u22654 PRBs in a subframe, the size depending on (pre-)configuration. Resource allocation, sensing, and resource selection are performed in units of a sub-channel, although it is possible that a small number of PRBs within a sub-channel are not used for transmission.\nFor PSCCH, the resource pool definition depends on whether adjacent or non-adjacent transmission of PSCCH and PSSCH has been (pre-)configured for the resource pool. Adjacent transmission is achieved by defining the lowest pair of PRBs in each subchannel as candidates to contain PSCCH, and PSSCH is transmitted in the contiguous PRBs above them for the allocated number of subchannels. Non-adjacent transmission is achieved by defining sequential pairs of PRBs starting at the lowest frequency of the resource pool for PSCCH, and associating the nth pair to PSSCH transmission occupying from the nth PSSCH sub-channel for the allocated number of subchannels. Figure 5.2.1-1 shows examples of adjacent and non-adjacent transmission. To receive PSCCH, a UE has to monitor each defined pair of PRBs to determine whether PSCCH has been transmitted in them.\n\nA resource pool is divided into sub-channels in the frequency domain, which are consecutively non-overlapping sets of \u226510 PRBs in a slot, the size depending on (pre-)configuration. Resource allocation, sensing, and resource selection are performed in units of a sub-channel. The UE's PSCCH occupies a (pre-)configurable number of PRBs within one sub-channel, starting from the lowest PRB of the PSSCH it schedules. \nWithin the slots that can be used for PSSCH transmission, there can be from 7 to 14 of the symbols reserved for sidelink operation, of which PSSCH can be transmitted in 5 to 12 symbols. The remaining sidelink symbols transmit some or all of PSCCH, PSFCH, AGC symbol(s), guard symbol(s). Refer to Figure 6.2.1-1 for examples of slot formats.\nResource pools are (pre-)configured to a UE separately from the transmission perspective (TX pools) and the reception perspective (RX pools). This allows a UE to monitor for PSCCH, and hence receive PSSCH transmissions, in resource pools other than those in which it transmits, so that it can attempt to receive transmissions made by other UEs in those RX pools.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the minimum resource allocation unit in the time domain for PSSCH transmission?

When activated, PDCP packet duplication allows sending the same PDCP PDU on two independent transmission paths: via the primary RLC entity and a secondary RLC entity, thus increasing reliability and reducing latency.\nPDCP packet duplication is supported in the following cases:\n-\tfor SRBs using RLC AM;\n-\tfor DRBs using RLC UM or AM.\nFor DRBs, duplication can be activated and deactivated by a MAC CE. In addition, for DRBs, PDCP packet duplication can be activated upon configuration by RRC signalling. For SRBs, once duplication is configured, it is always activated.\nWhen PDCP packet duplication is activated, the associated logical channels are restricted to be sent only on certain serving cells to ensure the duplicates are sent on different serving cells. The restriction is lifted when PDCP packet duplication is deactivated. When CA duplication is configured for an SRB, one of the logical channels associated to the SRB is restricted to be sent only on the serving cells including PCell and PSCell.\n\nFigure 6.2-2: UL SPS repetition on one SPS configuration\nIn case of new data arrival, a UE has to wait for the next first (s)TTI of the transmission window before being able to transmit new data (as depicted in Figure 2). With a single UL SPS configuration, this induces a maximum delay of P (s)TTIs. To shorten this delay, the specifications allow multiple SPS configurations for the same TTI length to be activated on the same serving cell. By appropriate setting of P, K and the number of SPS configurations for a given TTI length, it is possible to reduce the maximum delay for the UE to be able to transmit UL data to 1 (s)TTI. Different HARQ processes are associated with different SPS configurations for a given (s)TTI length and the cyclic shift for the UL Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS) can be configured independently for each SPS configuration.\nFigure 6.2-3: UL SPS repetition with two SPS configurations\nPDCP packet duplication\nIn case of Carrier Aggregation (CA) or in case of Dual Connectivity (DC), PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) packet duplication can be applied to improve the overall reliability for downlink and possibly for uplink depending on UE power limitation.

The architecture allows for a quiet zone (QZ) roughly the size of the spot on the mirror illuminated by the source. The key to this architecture is locating the source at the focus of the parabola that describers the mirror.\nThe burgeoning number of FR2 bands place increasing demands on both, the antenna, as well as the RFFE in test equipment.\nThe effect of off-focus test system antenna in IFF systems was studied before listing ramifications to inter-band test requirements. The components of the IFF are much larger than the wavelength of signals under test. The primary effect of the EM solution to the IFF problem can hence be determined by an equivalent optics problem.  \nFrom the geometry of a parabola, there is a unique location (the focus) that allows a test antenna to appear as a far-field antenna after reflection off the mirror. The far-field characteristic comes from the wavefront geometry that is transformed by the mirror from spherical to planar. The planar wavefront is normal to the optical axis of the mirror. Unfortunately, the favorable characteristics of the parabolic mirror are limited to proper placement of the source, and optical aberration is expected outside the geometry demands specific to the mirror in use. For example, in astronomy, the \u2018coma\u2019 aberration has long been associated with telescopes when wavefronts of incoming light are not normal to the optical axis.\n\n5.3.3 \tInter-band testing ramifications\nThe primary dependency of inter-band test set ramifications is the frequency coverage of each antenna in an IFF system with multiple antennae. \n5.3.3.1 \tSingle antenna\nFor bands that can be supported by a single antenna, the condition to evaluate is if the antenna is not at the focus of the mirror. On-focus single antenna IFF systems have already been studied and their MU quantified, and do not need to be considered again in this context. Non-ideal (off-focus) location causes the following problems:\n-\tA shifted QZ due to beam tilt. Note however that all bands have the same AoA at the UE. \n-\tBeam tilt causes the AoA to no longer be parallel to the optical axis. This aspect must be properly considered during system calibration; for example, a directional calibration antenna placed at the QZ must be pointed accurately along the arrival direction for an accurate path loss estimate.\nProvided the problems above are accounted for, UEs with either CBM or IBM can tolerate an IFF system with an off-focus source.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which test system is impacted by off-focus antenna?

If remote interference is detected, the gNB-DU can send out the RIM-RS. In the aggressor set, if a gNB-DU detects the RIM-RS sent by the victim gNB(s), it sends to the gNB-CU the RIM-RS detection status and the victim Set ID. The gNB-CU acts as a coordinator on behalf of its affiliated gNB-DUs, where the gNB-CU merges the outgoing RIM information received from its gNB-DUs in the aggressor set and forwards the merged information to all the gNBs in the victim set.\nSimilarly, in the victim set, the gNB-CU distributes the incoming RIM information to all the gNB-DUs in the set, as indicated in the RIM information received from the aggressor set.\nIn addition, to facilitate consolidation of RIM information, the gNB-DU provides the associated aggressor set ID and the victim set ID of each serving cell to the gNB-CU.\n\nTo mitigate remote interference, the network enables RIM frameworks for coordination between victim and aggressor gNBs. The coordination communication in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. The backhaul-based RIM framework uses a combination of wireless and backhaul communication, while in the wireless framework, the communication is purely wireless.\nIn both frameworks, all gNBs in a victim set simultaneously transmit an identical RIM reference signal carrying the victim set ID over the air.\nIn the wireless framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measures, and send back a RIM reference signal carrying the aggressor set ID. The RIM reference signal sent by the aggressor is able to provide information whether the atmospheric ducting phenomenon exists. The victim gNBs realize the atmospheric ducting phenomenon have ceased upon not receiving any reference signal sent from aggressors.\nIn the RIM backhaul framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measures, and establish backhaul coordination towards the victim gNB set. The backhaul messages are sent from individual aggressor gNBs to individual victim gNB, where the signalling is transparent to the core network. The RIM backhaul messages from aggressor to victim gNBs carry the indication about the detection or disappearance of RIM reference signal. Based on the indication from the backhaul message, the victim gNBs realize whether the atmospheric ducting and the consequent remote interference have ceased.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('In a remote interference scenario, how are victim and aggressor gNBs grouped?

The V3 interface between the UE and the V2X Control Function can be secured in the same way as the PC3 interface between the UE and the ProSe Function, as in TS 33.303 [5]; PSK TLS with GBA (Pre-shared Key Transport Layer Security with Generic Bootstrapping Architecture) is used for UE initiated messages, while PSK TLS including option of GBA push are used for network initiated messages.\n\nFor V2X application data, the security requirements are all satisfied by employing application-layer security as defined in other SDOs (e.g. IEEE or ETSI ITS), which is outside the scope of 3GPP. The field related to group keys are all set to zero for PC5 based V2X communications, and the LTE security mechanism for air interface confidentiality (see TS 33.401 [6]) is used for LTE-Uu based V2X communications.\nNo additional privacy features beyond the regular LTE privacy features are supported for LTE-Uu based V2X communications, while the privacy requirements will likely depend on regional regulatory requirements and/or operator policy.
