The (chargeable) event is recognised in the NE /NF that handles it, based on e.g. signalling exchange between the user equipment and the NE/NF. The event is then mapped onto a single charging event as specified in the middle tier TS that applies to that NE/NF.\n-\tIn online charging, the charging event is transferred to the EBCF via the Ro or CAP reference point, and the chargeable event is authorised after successfully performing Credit-Control on the subscriber account. The complete procedure must occur in real-time. If the chargeable event is not authorised by the OCS (e.g. when the subscriber account does not contain sufficient credit), the NE rejects the resource usage pertaining to that chargeable event.\n-\tThe event charging procedure may occur with or without reservation of units from the subscriber\u2019s account (\"Event Charging with Unit Reservation\" (ECUR),\"Immediate Event Charging\" (IEC) or \"Post Event Charging\" (PEC), respectively), as described above.

The CTF determines whether the request corresponds to an user / network event (event based charging, e.g. MMS) or whether a session shall be started (session based charging, e.g. IP CAN bearer). Generally, this property is built into the network capability, or service, that the NE provides, and described in the middle tier TSs.\nNote that TS 23.078 [207] also specifies online charging capability in the SGSN and MSC based on CAMEL, i.e. using the CAP reference point towards the OCS. This functionality is outside the scope of the present document.\nIn event based charging, a network / user event (e.g. MM submission) corresponds to a single chargeable event. In session based charging, at least two chargeable events are needed, one each to describe the start and the end of the session, respectively. Multiple interim events are possible in order to describe changes of session characteristics (e.g. change of IP CAN bearer QoS or change of IMS session media types), or when certain limits, e.g. time or volume, are exceeded.

With the MARCOM feature, the work on maritime communication services is officially included in the scope of 3GPP standardization so 3GPP enabling technologies can be applicable to for maritime usage from 3GPP Release 16 onwards.\nThe first 3GPP Technical Specification (TS) 22.119 [1] covering service requirements (Stage 1) is specified for the support of maritime communication (MARCOM) over 3GPP systems.\nThe maritime domain, one of the 5G vertical domains in 3GPP, is moving forward with the digitalisation and mobilisation of commercial as well as safety fields. Legacy 3GPP-based technologies and solutions can be beneficial to the digitalisation and mobilisation of the maritime domain though some of the legacy 3GPP enabling technologies and solutions may not be able to fully support the performances required by the maritime domain. The maritime radio environment was not originally considered by 3GPP when the technical specifications and solutions were standardised for LTE and 5G. \n\nHowever, most of the legacy mobile services and IoT services based on capabilities of EPS and 5GS specified in 3GPP specifications are applicable to maritime usage for the support of mobile broadband services, and for the support of IoT services or machine-type communication services in a vessel at sea. \nIn addition, there are service scenarios and requirements specified in 3GPP specifications based on requirements of other related vertical domains (e.g. public safety domain, automotive domain, factory automation domain, and satellite industrial domain). Some requirements derived by service scenarios from these related vertical domains are applicable to the maritime domain. Thus, it is beneficial to use 3GPP enabling technologies developed to satisfy those requirements for the maritime domain in terms of the economy of scale.\nFor example, satellite access is one of the 3GPP radio access networks supported over the 5G system, so it is possible to provide seamless maritime mobile services by integrating multiple access technologies including satellite access depending on the service scenarios. In addition, Vertical LAN that can replace Ethernet-based access are applicable to indoor maritime mobile services inside a vessel.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which 5G vertical domain is the maritime domain a part of?

It consists of buffering uplink packets in the target PSA in order to prevent there is packet loss if the application client sends UL packets to a new EAS before the new EAS is prepared to handle them.

The adaptation applies to Type3-PDCCH CSS sets or USS sets on the active DL BWP of the serving cell. The adaptation is triggered according to the PDCCH monitoring adaptation indication field, if present, in DCI format 0_1/0_2/1_1/1_2. With the fast adaptation mechanisms, UE can be indicated to perform reduced PDCCH monitoring at the end of or after a duration of data scheduling, thereby achieving UE power saving with minimum impact to data scheduling. \nUE power saving can be achieved through Rel-17 SSSG switching mechanism when Rel-17 SSSG configuration is configured. UE can be indicated to switch to a target SSSG via the indication of a scheduling DCI. If search space switch timer is also configured, UE switches to the SSSG of the lowest group index after timer expiration if no detected DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI/CS-RNTI/MCS-C-RNTI for the configured timer duration. The switch delay is at least Pswitch symbols, and Pswitch depends on the numerology of the serving cell.

It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths.

A common API framework within 3GPP will allow for a consistent development of northbound APIs across multiple working groups, i.e. when defining northbound APIs to abstract or expose the underlying 3GPP network capabilities to 3rd party applications. Intended users of CAPIF are third-party developers that may not be familiar with 3GPP networks and their underlying complexities.\nIn Release 15, the technical report TR 23.722 was provided to cover key issues, architecture requirements, functional architecture model, and corresponding solutions that are relevant to the definition of a common API framework applicable to any service APIs when used by northbound entities. Subsequently, still in Release 15, a stage-2 Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs (CAPIF) specification was developed in TS\u00a023.222, based on the solutions and conclusions of TR 23.722. The work item summary for Release 15 CAPIF is available in TS\u00a021.915 [1].\n\nFor API consumers or invokers (in particular for 3rd party API developers), a consistent and uniform API framework across multiple northbound API specifications is necessary. In 3GPP Release-15, a Common API Framework (CAPIF) was introduced to support the common API aspects (e.g. authentication, authorization, publishing, discovery, access control policy, etc.), which allows the northbound service APIs to be integrated into CAPIF, such that the API invokers can utilize a single framework for accessing and invoking the 3GPP northbound APIs.\nTR 23.722\u00a0[3] is a (Stage 2) technical report that analyses existing API frameworks, and identifies requirements and potential architecture solutions to support a common approach for API development within 3GPP, including recommendations for the normative work.\nTS 23.222\u00a0[4] specifies the (Stage 2) functional architecture model, procedures and information flows needed to support the CAPIF, and guidelines for a consistent development of northbound API (service and CAPIF APIs) in 3GPP.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of the Common API Framework (CAPIF) for 3GPP Northbound APIs?

The architecture is described in clause\u00a04.4.8.4.\n4.4.8.2\tArchitecture to support IEEE Time Sensitive Networking\nThe 5G System is integrated with the external network as a TSN bridge. This \"logical\" TSN bridge (see Figure 4.4.8.2-1) includes TSN Translator functionality for interoperation between TSN Systems and 5G System both for user plane and control plane. 5GS TSN translator functionality consists of Device-side TSN translator (DS-TT) and Network-side TSN translator (NW-TT). The TSN AF is part of 5GC and provides the control plane translator functionality for the integration of the 5GS with a TSN network, e.g. the interactions with the CNC. 5G System specific procedures in 5GC and RAN, wireless communication links, etc. remain hidden from the TSN network. To achieve such transparency to the TSN network and the 5GS to appear as any other TSN Bridge, the 5GS provides TSN ingress and egress ports via DS-TT and NW-TT. DS-TT and NW-TT optionally support:\n\nIntegration with IEEE TSN\nTSC is a communication service that supports deterministic and/or isochronous communication with high reliability and availability. It provides packet transport with Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics such as bounded latency and reliability, where end systems and relay/transmit nodes can be strictly synchronized. In Release 16, main focus was on integration with IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). \nThe 5G System also enables support for TSN time synchronization. In order to support time synchronization, the entire E2E 5G system can be considered as an IEEE 802.1AS [104] \"time-aware system\". UE, gNB, UPF, NW-TT and DS- TTs are synchronized with the 5G GM (i.e. the 5G internal system clock), which keeps these network elements synchronized. The TTs located at the edge of 5G system provides all functions related to IEEE 802.1AS. \nFurthermore, this feature has also introduced TSC assistance parameters were introduced to facilitate optimized QoS scheduling for time sensitive and deterministic traffic.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What does 5GS act as when integrated with IEEE TSN network?

Uplink support added in Release-14 is conceptually similar to Dual Connectivity (DC) uplink support, with some adjustments made for WLAN: the eNB may configure an uplink data split threshold and if the data available for transmission in the UE is above that threshold, the UE submits PDCP PDUs to either AM RLC entity or WLAN. The selection of which PDCP PDUs to send via LTE or WLAN is left of UE implementation. If the data available for transmission is below the configured threshold, the UE sends PDCP PDUs via LTE or WLAN, as configured by the eNB using another IE.\nIn Release-13, LWA configuration is released upon handover. In Release-14, an enhancement has been added, allowing the UE to retain the LWA configuration and therefore to remain associated to the current WLAN AP (if in coverage) during handover. Therefore, during LTE HO, WLAN transmission and reception can continue. To support this functionality, a new procedure referred to as \"Handover without WT change\" has been defined. In this procedure, during the handover, the target eNB initiates the WT Addition procedure (to the same WT the UE is associated with) and the source eNB may postpone the WT Release Request, so that the data may be sent/received via WLAN during the HO. As the UE may need to temporary use two keys to decipher PDCP PDUs received from the target eNB and from the source eNB (via the WT), the end marker approach has been agreed, in which the source eNB sends the end marker after sending the last PDCP PDU.

An MDA Function may optionally be deployed as one or more AI/ML inference  function(s) in which the relevant ML entities are used for inference per the corresponding MDA capability. Specifications for MDA ML entity training to enable ML entity deployments are given in TS\u00a028.105 [24].\n6\tMDA in management loop\n\n5.1.2\tML entity validation\n5.1.2.1\tDescription\nDuring the ML training process, the generated ML entity (see 3GPP TS 28.105 [4]) needs to be validated. The purpose of ML validation is to evaluate the performance of the ML entity when performing on the validation data, and to identify the variance of the performance on the training data and the validation data. If the variance is not acceptable, the entity would need to be tuned (re-trained) before being made available to the consumer and used for inference.\nThe training data and validation data are normally split from the same data set with a certain ratio in terms of the quantity of the data examples, therefore they have the same pattern. The training data set is used to create (fine-tune) the ML entity, while the validation data set is used to qualify performance of the trained entity.\n5.1.2.2\tUse cases\n5.1.2.2.1\tML entity validation performance reporting\nIn the ML training, the ML entity is generated based on the learning from the training data and validated using validation data. The performance of the ML entity has tight dependency on the data (i.e. training data) from which the ML entity is generated. Therefore, an ML entity performing well on the training data may not necessarily perform well on other data e.g. while conducting inference. If the performance of ML entity is not good enough as result of ML validation, the ML entity will be tuned (re-trained) and validated again. The process of ML entity generation and validation is repeated by the ML training function, until the performance of the ML entity meets the expectation on both training data and validation data. The producer in the end selects one or more ML entities with the best level performance on both training data and validation data as the result of the ML training, and reports to the consumer. The performance of each selected ML entity on both training data and validation data also needs to be reported.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('In which specification are the training guidelines for MDA ML entities given?

LTE radio network dimensioning is typically optimized for data services. To avoid negative impacts on user experience for VoLTE subscribers in areas with weak LTE coverage, a handover to 2G or 3G is performed sooner, i.e. at a higher RSRP level, for UEs with established voice bearers compared to UEs with only data bearers.\nAs in the Technical Specification for Multimedia Telephony Service over IMS (MTSI), TS 26.114, which is used as basis for the GSMA IR.92 VoLTE profile, there have been several tools for increased robustness of speech calls with initial selection of Codecs and their Configuration and in-call dynamic rate and mode adaptation and application layer redundancy. EVS (Enhanced Voice Services), especially the EVS Channel Aware mode, demonstrates higher robustness against transmission errors than AMR and AMR-WB codecs.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What does the Robust Call Setup for VoLTE subscriber in LTE Work Item aim to address?

A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted.\nA remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID.

The NF provider needs to be sure about the identity of the NF consumer before serving. Even though a higher layer authentication could serve the purpose of the NF consumer authentication, protection in the transport layer can be very important for a PLMN to function properly. Moreover, the SBI opens up the possibility to run packet core in a general-purpose cloud environment where the communication between inter PLMN and intra PLMN need to be secure and integrity protected.\nHaving transport layer integrity and authentication mechanism the transport protocol is harden against both attacks and random corruptions that could affect the transport protocols action. For example, cryptographic integrity protection is many magnitudes better at detecting modifications of the transport protocol packet. Cryptographic integrity protection captures packet modifications of both random types, as well as hostile modifications, where checksums only have a weaker protection against random errors. This improvement prevents fouling up the transport protocol state, affecting performance and loss recovery. Data errors in IP/TCP packets that the TCP checksum fails to detect will result in the corrupt data being passed to TLS. TLS integrity verification of the TLS record will detect this corruption. Normally in this case, there are no alternative to terminating the TCP connection and restart it and re-issue the outstanding HTTP requests.

Rel-16 Mobile Terminating Early Data Transmission (MT-EDT) allows one downlink data transmission during the random access procedure triggered in response to a paging message. This feature allows the eNB to decide whether to initiate Mobile Terminated EDT procedures towards the UE based on the data size received from the core network. Mobile Terminating Early Data Transmission (MT-EDT) is only supported in EPC.\nSupport for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode (FDD)\nIn Rel-15, signalling overhead and power consumption reductions were introduced by the (mobile-originated) early data transmission (EDT) feature, where data can be transmitted already in Msg3 during the random-access procedure.\nIn Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR). This feature allows eNB to configure uplink resources, in which a UE in IDLE mode can send UL transmission without performing random access procedures. The UE can be potentially configured with a cyclic shift of DMRS, which allows sharing of the preconfigured resources under which up to two users can transmit NPUSCH simultaneously when the NPUSCH transmission is larger than or equal to 64ms for 12-tone allocation. By skipping the random access procedures, the uplink transmission efficiency can be improved and UE power consumption is reduced. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change.

Exposure of relevant (and possibly aggregated) performance parameters ensures a quick reaction in case of failure as well as identifying network connectivity, performance and other related problems. \nNetwork diagnostic information needs to be generated automatically and, in case of a hosted or virtual network deployment, be made available to the tenant of the network via a suitable API.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What does network diagnostics aim to achieve?

This is an improvement over Rel-16 wherein the access performance measurements are always conducted over the default QoS flow and, therefore, provide a rough estimate of the RTT / PLR.\n\tWhether the access performance measurements for a data flow are conducted over the default QoS flow (as in Rel-16), or over the same QoS flow used to carry the data flow, is determined by the network during the MA PDU Session establishment. More details can be found in [1], clause 5.32.5.\n-\tLoad-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages: This introduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may provide an \"autonomous load-balance indicator\" in which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This means that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \"autonomous load-balance indicator\" can maximize the throughput of a given data flow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.\n\n8.2.197\tSteering Mode Indicator\nThe Steering Mode Indicator IE shall be encoded as shown in Figure 8.2.197-1.\nFigure 8.2.197.-1: Steering Mode Indicator\nThe following flags are coded within Octet 5:\n-\tBit 1 \u2013ALBI (Autonomous Load Balancing Indicator): If this bit is set to \"1\", the autonomous load-balance is allowed.\n-\tBit 2 \u2013UEAI (UE Assistance Indicator): If this bit is set to \"1\", the UE-assistance operation is allowed.\n-\tBit 3 to 8 Spare, for future use and set to \"0\".\nThe ALBI and UEAI shall not be set to \"1\" at the same time.\n8.2.198\tGroup Id\nThe Group Id IE type shall be encoded as shown in Figure 8.2.198-1.

This \"logical\" TSN bridge (see Figure 4.4.8.2-1) includes TSN Translator functionality for interoperation between TSN Systems and 5G System both for user plane and control plane. 5GS TSN translator functionality consists of Device-side TSN translator (DS-TT) and Network-side TSN translator (NW-TT). The TSN AF is part of 5GC and provides the control plane translator functionality for the integration of the 5GS with a TSN network, e.g. the interactions with the CNC. 5G System specific procedures in 5GC and RAN, wireless communication links, etc. remain hidden from the TSN network. To achieve such transparency to the TSN network and the 5GS to appear as any other TSN Bridge, the 5GS provides TSN ingress and egress ports via DS-TT and NW-TT.

It provides packet transport with Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics such as bounded latency and reliability, where end systems and relay/transmit nodes can be strictly synchronized. In Release 16, main focus was on integration with IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). \nThe 5G System also enables support for TSN time synchronization. In order to support time synchronization, the entire E2E 5G system can be considered as an IEEE 802.1AS [104] \"time-aware system\".

The low latency service (e.g. gaming) is maintained with the same QoS settings as the UE moves from the service hosting environment to an Application Server (AS) connected to an evolved Residential Gateway (eRG). While the AS can be a standalone platform, it can also be an on-site extension of an in-network Service Hosting Environment, e.g. an edge computing platform. In this case, the operator of the AS (e.g., a MEC server operator), can influence discovering/authorizing/orchestrating a residential application/service on the AS. The AS can be under the control of a 5G network operator, a customer or a third party. The service hosting environment and AS are served by the same 3GPP 5G core network (5G-CN).\nFigure\u00a05.11.1-1.

This transport connection between each RN and its OAM, using IP, is provided by the DeNB; the reference architecture is shown in Figure 4.7.7.1-1. RN OAM traffic is transported over the Un interface, and it shares resources with the rest of the traffic, including UEs attached to the DeNB. The secure connection between the RN and its OAM may be direct or hop-by-hop, i.e. involving intermediate hops trusted by the operator for this purpose.\nFigure 4.7.7.1-1: Relay OAM architecture.\nIt has to be noted that Figure 4.7.7.1-1 refers to normal operating conditions for the RN, i.e. after the initial start-up phase has been completed.

Traffic counters generate bursts of traffic, but their transport need not be real-time. Configuration messages from OAM to the RN will also generate small bursts of traffic, possibly with lower priority than alarms but still delay-sensitive: when a configuration is committed on the OAM, the time interval between the commitment and the effect on the equipment shall be small.\nAlarm messages and commands should be transported on a high-priority bearer, while counters may be transported on a lower priority bearer. There is no need to specify a new QCI value other than those already standardized.\nAlarm messages and commands may be mapped over a dedicated bearer or over the same bearer that carries S1 and/or X2 messages between the RN and the DeNB.\nOAM software download to the RN may generate larger amounts of data, but both the required data rate and the priority of this kind of traffic are much lower than in the case of alarms, commands and counters.

For REFSENS the recently agreed value of -82.8 dBm/50 MHz is used, and for MBR 1.0 dB (rounded up from 0.7 dB) is used [2].  Table 7.1-1 below summarizes the parameters.\nTable 7.1-1: Preliminary demodulation test setup SNR calculation parameters for band n262\nThe maximum achievable SNR for the demodulation test setup can be summarized as shown in Table 7.1-2.\nTable 7.1-2: Comparison of maximum SNR between TR38.810 and preliminary extension to band n262\nIn general, there is a 3.5 dB degradation in maximum achievable SNR for band n262 relative to the budgeted values in TR38.810.\n\nAnother parameter in the SNR calculation which scales with frequency is cable loss per meter.  Using the datasheets from four different commercially available RF cables, which are rated up to at least 90 GHz, we calculate the average cable loss per meter (averaging performed in linear gain units), as shown in Figure 7.2.3-2 below.\nFigure 7.2.3-2: Cable loss per meter vs. frequency\nWe further note that the SNR calculation related to cable loss also includes connector losses and additional margin.Demodulation test system setup parameters required for SNR calculation are summarized in Table 7.2.3-1.\nTable 7.2.3-1: Demodulation test setup SNR calculation parameters for band n263\nThe maximum achievable DL SNR is summarized in Table 7.2.3-2.\nTable 7.2.3-2: Maximum DL testable SNR preliminary extension for band n263\nA method to adjust \u2206thermal value in Noc setting methodology can increase max achievable DL SNR. \u2206thermal is the actual difference between UE thermal noise level and wanted noise level.

In practical UE design, to avoid severe blockage, the metal frame near the antenna module can be removed and replaced by other materials, but the V/H element may still suffer from different loss, which still lead to difference between V-pol and H-pol.\nFigure 6.3.6-1The radiation pattern of a pair of V/H element in 1x4 antenna module\nIf the gain difference exists between V-pol and H-pol, for each receiver branch, the projection from  and  should be calculated, and the following procedure to calculate received signal can be used:\nStep-1: Extract the antenna gain in \u03b8 direction and \u03c6 direction in module reference system when only V-elements are activated, i.e., GV,M (M, M) and GV,M (M, M)\nStep-2: Extract the antenna gain in \u03b8 direction and \u03c6 direction in module reference system when only H-elements are activated, i.e., GH,M (M, M) and GH,M (M, M)\n\nB.2.1.10\tInfluence of the XPD\nThis factor takes into account the uncertainty caused due to the finite cross polar discrimination (XPD) between the two polarization ports of the measurement probe.

Typically, a single-polarized reference antenna with known gain is placed at the centre of the quiet zone and the total attenuation, L, between the reference antenna terminal and the feed antenna terminals is determined as part of the range reference calibration procedure.\nFigure B.2.1.10-1: Calibration Setup\nSince the reference antenna is considered a single-polarized antenna, the XPD effect is negligible. Since the measurement probe is assumed to be a dual-linearly polarized antenna, leakage from one terminal/polarization to the other, i.e., XPD, needs to be considered.\nThe dual-linearly polarized measurement probe has two terminals corresponding to a set of orthogonal polarizations, \uf071 and \uf066 which match the orientations of the reference antenna.

The re-attempts continue to fail until UE enters the coverage and respond to the paging attempts. This repetitive paging attempts result in the wastage of network resources. As an example, the use case includes a user or a group of users getting into an area, with no cellular coverage on a regular basis for a considerably long duration, for e.g. the user gets into a shielded room for some testing purpose every day for a defined period. The Network initiated paging for such users will fail until they are back in the area with cellular coverage. This would result in in-efficient network resource usage.\nIt is desirable to use MDAS (Management data analytic service) to optimize the current paging procedures in 5G networks. MDAS producer provides an analytics output containing the user(s) paging analytics indicating the time window at which a group of users are OOC on a regular basis at the particular location. MDAS producer also provides the geographical map within which the UEs would experience paging issues and hence will not be able to respond on a network-initiated paging. Based on the provided MDA output, MDAS consumer (e.g.\u00a0AMF, gNB) decides on whether, when and where to initiate or not to initiate the paging procedures, thereby ensuring the efficient paging procedures and optimal network resource utilization, as paging can be initiated only when there are more chances for it to be successful.\n\n4.1\tOverview\nManagement Data Analytics (MDA), as a key enabler of automation and intelligence, is considered a foundational capability for mobile networks and services management and orchestration.\nThe MDA provides a capability of processing and analysing data related to network and service events and status including e.g. performance measurements, KPIs, Trace/MDT/RLF/RCEF reports, QoE reports, alarms, configuration data, network analytics data, and service experience data from AFs, etc. to provide analytics output, i.e. statistics or predictions,, root cause analysis issues, and may also include recommendations to enable necessary actions for network and service operations. The MDA output is provided by the MDAS (Management Data analytics Service) producer to the corresponding consumer(s) that requested the analytics.\nThe MDA can identify ongoing issues impacting the performance of the network and services, and help to identify in advance potential issues that may cause potential failure and/or performance degradation. The MDA can also assist to predict the network and service demand to enable the timely resource provisioning and deployments which would allow fast time-to-market network and service deployments.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the MDA capability for paging optimization analysis used for?

While there have been efforts at the system level, the overall application layer architecture needs supporting environment (such as provisioning, discovery, registration, enabler layer capability exposure, network capability exposure, support for service continuity) to enable edge applications over 3GPP networks. \nTS 23.558 [1] specifies the architecture, procedures and information flows to enable edge applications over 3GPP networks.\nArchitecture for enabling edge applications based on the architectures principles such as UE application portability, Edge Application portability, service differentiation and flexible deployment.\nThe Edge Data Network (EDN) is a local Data Network. Edge Application Server(s) and the Edge Enabler Server (EES) are contained within the EDN. EES is primarily responsible for enabling discovery of the EASs; Edge Enabler Client supports EAS discovery to the ACs in the UE; and, Edge Configuration Server, providing configurations to the EEC. The Edge Configuration Server provides configurations related to the EES, including details of the Edge Data Network hosting the EES.

The integration of the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) to the 5G Core (5GC) introduces Service Based Interfaces (SBA) for the related GBA Network Functions as well as specific GBA services for the User Data Management (UDM) network function in 5GC. In this way GBA can be used in 5GC deployments.\nThe 3GPP authentication infrastructure employed in GBA includes Home Network (HN) functions User Equipment (UE) functions and the 3GPP AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) protocol. This infrastructure is a very valuable asset of 3GPP operators and could be leveraged to enable application functions in the network and on the User Equipment (UE) side to establish shared cryptographic material based on 3GPP credentials. This is the motivation and purpose of the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) and GBA Push features developed in 3GPP since Rel-6. \n\n4.1\tIntroduction\nGeneric Authentication Architecture (GAA) is based on shared secrets provided by generic bootstrapping architecture (GBA).

During the bootstrapping procedure BSF also uses the Zh interface to request authentication vectors from HSS. The Zh interface is defined in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.109\u00a0[3]. The end result of the bootstrapping procedure is that both BSF and an UE have a security association in a form of a bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) and key material (Ks).\nAccording to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.220\u00a0[1] the bootstrapping procedure shall be based on HTTP Digest AKA as described in RFC\u00a03310\u00a0[6]. The protocol stack of the Ub interface in bootstrapping procedure is presented in figure\u00a04.1-1. The details are defined in the following clauses.\nFigure 4.1-1: Protocol stack of Ub interface\nThe bootstrapping procedure described in the present document can result to different key materials depending on whether ME-based or UICC-based GBA is used.

The NWDAF then collects measurements per cell and uses the measurements to determine user data congestion analytics.\nThe request for user data congestion related analytics indicates the location area information where congestion related analytics is desired or indicates a UE Identity that can be used by the NWDAF to determine the location area information where congestion related analytics is desired. When requesting user data congestion, the consumer may request the identifiers of the applications that contribute the most to the traffic in the area. The consumer may indicate how many applications should be reported by providing the maximum number of applications in the request or subscription.\n\n\tIf the request is to provide the list of applications that contribute the most to the traffic, then the NWDAF collects the input data from the UPF serving the UE location, or from the AF(s) by invoking Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service or Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe (if via NEF) or collects input data from both, AF and UPF. The input data is defined in Table 6.8.2-2.\n8.\tThe NWDAF derives requested analytics.\n9.\tThe NWDAF provides the analytics for congestion to the NF.\nFor continuous reporting:\n10.\tThe NF sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe Request to the NWDAF.

The NWDAF then determines an area of interest.\n12-13. The NWDAF subscribes to OAM services (as captured in 6.2.3.2) to get the measurement information for the UE location, possibly providing measurement thresholds. The NWDAF may obtain measurements by invoking management services that are defined in TS\u00a028.532\u00a0[6] and TS\u00a028.550\u00a0[7].\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What does the NWDAF collect from the UPF or the AF related to user data congestion analytics?

In general, any device that has intermittent small data packets in INACTIVE state will benefit from enabling small data transmission in INACTIVE. \nThe key enablers for small data transmission in NR, namely the INACTIVE state, 2-step, 4-step RACH and configured grant type-1 have already been specified as part of Rel-15 and Rel-16.

Since LBT may fail during a paging transmission attempt, multiple PDCCH monitoring occasions were introduced for NR-U. This allows the gNB to transmit the paging message when LBT is not successful at the first instance. As monitoring of multiple occasions increases UE power, gNB can let the UE stop further monitoring when there is no page for that UE by transmitting a Short Message on paging channel with a newly introduced bit for this purpose. The UE can also stop monitoring when it detects a paging for other UEs with the assumption that the gNB had access to the channel and thus there is no page for itself.\n\nReferences \nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in: https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=860063,860163\n[1]\tRP-220603, Status report for WI\n10\tEnergy efficiency, power saving\n10.1\tUE power saving enhancements for NR\nSummary based on the input provided by MediaTek Inc., ZTE in RP-221544.\nUser experience is key to 5G/NR success, not only in terms of experienced data rates and latency but also importantly UE power consumption.

This is illustrated in Fig. 1 below.\nFigure 8.3.3-1: Radio resources for EC traffic channel operation for Rel-13 and Rel-14.\nB. New uplink coverage class for improved uplink MCL performance\nWith introduction of the new uplink coverage class CC5, the uplink MCL performance for a EC-GSM-IoT device improves by additional 4 dB.

The new coverage class CC5 is specified both for 4 and 2 consecutive timeslot resources on UL with comparable MCL performance.\nOn CC5 uplink traffic channel the coverage improvement is achieved by increasing the number of bits for channel estimation along with a higher number of blind physical layer transmissions. The CC5 random access channel uses one of 2 specified extended access burst formats spanning across 2 timeslots: one format is based on an extended synchronization sequence whereas the other format is based on two successive bursts using partially blind physical layer transmission of bursts within a TDMA frame. The used format in a cell is broadcasted by the network, whilst the EC-GSM-IoT device supports both formats.\n\n7.2.1\tIntroduction\nExtended Coverage GSM for support of Internet of Things (EC-GSM-IoT) is an evolution of EGPRS providing a streamlined protocol implementation, reducing MS complexity while supporting energy efficient operation with extended coverage compared to GPRS/EGPRS.

The extended coverage is achieved by a high number of blind physical layer transmissions along with modified channel coding schemes.\nIn Release 13, the base station supporting EC-GSM-IoT requires minimum 4 consecutive timeslot resources reserved for packet data operation to support extended coverage operation. Furthermore, the coverage improvement for low power EC-GSM-IoT devices with 23 dBm output power is limited to 10 dB in this release.\nIn Release 14, as part of radio interface enhancements, EC operation with a reduced number of 2 consecutive timeslot resources both on DL and UL specified.

The conclusions of the RAN study item are documented in TR 37.873 [14]. Subsequent to the study items, work items were drafted in SA ([5]) and RAN ([10]) to implement optimisations to the UE radio capability signalling.\nThe work is divided into two subfeatures, UE radio capability ID and UE capability segmentation.\nUE Radio Capability ID\n\n4.16\tUE radio capability signalling optimisation\nUE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) is a feature that is optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[8]). RACS works by assigning an identifier to represent a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the UE radio capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned.

A new DCI format 2_6 is introduced with CRC scrambled by PS-RNTI (DCP) which contains the wakeup indication as well as SCell dormancy indication if configured.A PS-offset is semi-statically configured before DRX ON defining the start of the interval for the DCP monitor occasion as shown in Figure 1.More than one monitoring occasions could be configured for DCP on PCell for CA and SpCell for DC based on the search space and CORESET configurations.Minimum time gap is specified as the UE processing time as shown in Figure 1. UE is not required to monitor DCP at the interval of minimum time gap and within Active Time. \n\nIn 5G radio systems, users in connected mode keep monitoring the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), which carries scheduling grants transmitted by gNB. This continuous monitoring of the PDCCH forces users to stay in active mode even when there is no traffic to be scheduled, thus resulting in unnecessary power consumption. To mitigate this problem, 5G defines UE power saving schemes including Connected mode DRX (CDRX) and PDCCH monitoring adaptation (e.g. PDCCH skipping and Search Space Set Group switching). Both CDRX and PDCCH monitoring adaptation offer the possibility to reduce UE power consumption by alternating between active and sleep periods, by switching the monitoring frequency of PDCCH, and/or by skipping some of the PDCCH monitoring occasions.\nUE power saving schemes can be optimally configured according to the traffic characteristics of XR traffic described above to guarantee the delivering of a packet within the PDB and at the same time maximize the power saving gain.

The data collected could include measurements, such as Ec/No and RSCP for case of UMTS and RSRP and RSRQ for case of E-UTRAN, and statistical business level KPIs such as sampled call drop rate and application layer throughput. By periodically sampling these network performance data, managers of the operator can monitor overall performance of the network and compare performance differences between areas or periods. The statistical data sampling can be performed periodically e.g. weekly or hly. The drive test fleet\u2019s scale makes the amount of data samples under operators control. \nMDT can be used to replace or reduce drive test in this case. It is necessary for the MDT task to collect measurements in a way similar as the drive test do. To prevent unnecessary waste of network resources, operators need to specify the desired maximum number and amount of data samples collected through an MDT task. There is no need to notify the operator when the max number or amount is reached because that will not trigger any action of the operator.  It is necessary for the operators to specify the desired minimum number of UEs and amount of data samples collected in a MDT job so that the data collected can meet the business and management requirements. If a MDT job can not collect minimum amount of data in a given period of time, the operator need to be notified quickly at the end of the time period given by the operator so he can decide if he will need to send a drive test team in the field to replace the MDT job.       \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of MDT data collection?

A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted.\nA remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID.

In this case, the UE Radio Capability IDs the UE receives are applicable to the serving PLMN and uniquely identify the corresponding sets of UE radio capabilities and the UE Radio Capability for Paging(s) in this PLMN. The PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability ID includes a Version ID in its format. The value of the Version ID is the one configured in the UCMF, at time the UE Radio Capability ID value is assigned.

Rel-16 Mobile Terminating Early Data Transmission (MT-EDT) allows one downlink data transmission during the random access procedure triggered in response to a paging message. This feature allows the eNB to decide whether to initiate Mobile Terminated EDT procedures towards the UE based on the data size received from the core network. Mobile Terminating Early Data Transmission (MT-EDT) is only supported in EPC.\nSupport for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode (FDD)\nIn Rel-15, signalling overhead and power consumption reductions were introduced by the (mobile-originated) early data transmission (EDT) feature, where data can be transmitted already in Msg3 during the random-access procedure.\nIn Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR). This feature allows eNB to configure uplink resources, in which a UE in IDLE mode can send UL transmission without performing random access procedures. The UE can be potentially configured with a cyclic shift of DMRS, which allows sharing of the preconfigured resources under which up to two users can transmit NPUSCH simultaneously when the NPUSCH transmission is larger than or equal to 64ms for 12-tone allocation. By skipping the random access procedures, the uplink transmission efficiency can be improved and UE power consumption is reduced. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change. Additionally, it is possible to configure the TA as always valid within a given cell.\n\n7.2\tAdditional enhancements for NB-IoT and LTE-MTC\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-220530.\nThis Rel-17 work item introduced additional enhancements for NB-IoT and LTE-MTC based on features standardized in Rel-13 and enhancements performed from Rel-14 through Rel-16. Rel-17 adds features such as 16QAM for NB-IoT in downlink and uplink, 14 HARQ processes in downlink for HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs, NB-IoT neighbour cell measurement and triggering before RLF, NB-IoT carrier selection based on coverage level, and a maximum DL TBS of 1736 bits for HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs [1].\n16-QAM for unicast in UL and DL for NB-IoT\nFrom Rel-13 to Rel-16, an NB-IoT UE can use QPSK for unicast NPDSCH, and QPSK or BPSK for unicast NPUSCH.\nThis feature allows an NB-IoT UE to use 16-QAM for unicast NPDSCH with TBS up to 4968 bits for standalone and guard-band deployments and 3624 bits for in-band deployments; and allows an NB-IoT UE to use 16-QAM for unicast NPUSCH with TBS up to 2536 bits (which can be transmitted with up to half the time-domain resources with respect to QPSK). When 16-QAM for unicast NPDSCH is configured, an NB-IoT UE can report the channel quality report by reporting the recommended NPDCCH repetition and NPDSCH modulation and coding scheme.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which feature in Rel-16 allows transmission of uplink data payload using preconfigured uplink resources?

As part of ProSe services, a new D2D interface (designated as PC5, also known as sidelink at the physical layer) was introduced and now as part of the V2V WI it has been enhanced for vehicular use cases, specifically addressing high speed (up to 250Kph) and high density (thousands of nodes).\nTo that end, a few fundamental modifications to PC5 have been introduced.\nFirstly additional DMRS symbols have been added to handle the high Doppler associated with relative speeds of up to 500kph and at high frequency (5.9GHz ITS band being the main target). This results in the sub-frame structure illustrated in Figure 7.2-1.\n\nAs illustrated the V2V sub-frame for PC5 interface has 4 DMRS symbols, in addition to the Tx-Rx turnaround symbol at the end, allowing for better tracking of the channel at high speed.\nFigure 7.2-1: a V2V sub-frame for PC5 interface\nSecondly a new arrangement of scheduling assignment and data resources has been agreed. The arrangement is illustrated in Figure 7.2-2 and is designed to enhance the system level performance under high density while meeting the latency requirements of V2V. Scheduling assignments (SA or PSCCH) are transmitted in sub-channels using specific RBs across time. Data transmissions associated with said scheduling assignments are occupying adjacent RBs in the same subframe. Note that another variant where SA and associated data transmissions are not necessarily transmitted on adjacent RBs has also been standardized.\n3GPP\nRelease 14\t29\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)\nFigure 7.2-2: new arrangement of scheduling assignment and data resources\nFinally for distributed scheduling (a.k.a. Mode 4) a sensing with semi-persistent transmission based mechanism was introduced. V2V traffic from a device is mostly periodic in nature. This was utilized to sense congestion on a resource and estimate future congestion on that resource. Based on estimation resources were booked. This technique optimizes the use of the channel by enhancing resource separation between transmitters that are using overlapping resources.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of the sub-frame structure in V2V communications?

Granting each quota causes some of the user's credit to be reserved at the Server. It is then possible that all the user's credit may be reserved when the user wishes to start using a new service. The new service may then be denied, despite the fact that there remains unused credit in the user's account.\nTo avoid such credit fragmentation and unnecessary load on the server, it is possible for multiple quotas provided to be linked into a credit pool. The client may then consider the quotas to form a single pool of credit, from which all services draw units.\nThe reference to a credit pool includes a translation factor derived from the rating parameter, which translates from units of a specific type (time/volume) to the abstract units in the pool.\n\nThis reflects one possible implementation option, whereby each quota remains managed independently from the others. This approach can result in extra usage reports being sent over Sxb for RG1 or RG2 before the credit pool is exhausted.\nFigure C.2.2.2-1: Online charging with Credit Pooling (alt 1)\n1.\tUpon the request from the CP function for RG1 and RG2, the OCS grants:\n\tRG1: quota 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG1), where the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to which the RG1 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier (e.g. 0.1);\n\tRG2: quotas 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG2), where the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to which the RG2 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier (e.g. 0.5);\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of credit pooling in charging?

This feature allows the network to deploy EC-GSM-IoT services by allocating a minimum number of timeslots (i.e. 2) for EC traffic channel operation. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 below.\nFigure 8.3.3-1: Radio resources for EC traffic channel operation for Rel-13 and Rel-14.\nB. New uplink coverage class for improved uplink MCL performance\nWith introduction of the new uplink coverage class CC5, the uplink MCL performance for a EC-GSM-IoT device improves by additional 4 dB. This feature allows the low power EC-GSM-IoT devices with output power of 23 dBm to\n3GPP\nRelease 14\t40\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)\noperate in further extended coverage condition upto 14 dB compared to EGPRS. The new coverage class CC5 is specified both for 4 and 2 consecutive timeslot resources on UL with comparable MCL performance.\nOn CC5 uplink traffic channel the coverage improvement is achieved by increasing the number of bits for channel estimation along with a higher number of blind physical layer transmissions. The CC5 random access channel uses one of 2 specified extended access burst formats spanning across 2 timeslots: one format is based on an extended synchronization sequence whereas the other format is based on two successive bursts using partially blind physical layer transmission of bursts within a TDMA frame. The used format in a cell is broadcasted by the network, whilst the EC-GSM-IoT device supports both formats.\n\nAs part of radio interface enhancements introduced in Release 14, Extended Coverage (EC) operation with a reduced number of 2 consecutive timeslot resources both on DL and UL is enabled. In addition, a new uplink coverage class CC5 is added to improve the MCL performance in uplink by 4 dB compared to Release 13, which is specified both for 4 and 2 consecutive time slot resources.\nThe two aspects (EC operation with reduced number of PDCH resources) and (New uplink coverage class for improved uplink MCL performance) are developed below.\nA. EC operation with reduced number of PDCH resources\nAn additional coverage class mapping of blind physical layer transmissions is introduced for higher coverage classes CC2 to CC4 where only 2 consecutive timeslot resources per TDMA frame are available for extended coverage operation. The new coverage class mapping will have increased (i.e. doubled) BTTI compared to existing coverage classes as blind physical layer transmissions need to be extended over twice the number of TDMA frames compared to 4 consecutive timeslot resources.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('How many blind physical layer transmissions are required in the new coverage class mapping for EC operation?

The feature defines QoE measurement configuration and measurement reporting containers, and the feature uses the MDT framework [1]. QoE measurement configuration received from OAM or CN is encapsulated in a container, which is inserted in a Measurement Control message and forwarded to the UE transparently. QoE measurements received from UE higher layer are inserted in a container in a Measurement Report message and sent over SRB4.\nThe QoE measurement configuration is supported in CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH states, whereas the QoE measurement reporting is supported in CELL_DCH state only.\nBoth signalling based and management based initiation cases are allowed. For the signalling based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated towards a specific UE from CN nodes using the MDT mechanism as described in clause 5.1.3 [1]; for the management based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated from OAM targeting an area (without targeting a specific UE).\n\nFor management-based QoE measurement activation, the OAM sends one or more QoE measurement configurations directly to the gNB. The QoE measurement configuration for management-based activation also includes an application layer measurement configuration list and the corresponding information for QoE measurement collection. The gNB selects UE(s) that meet the required QoE measurement capability, area scope and slice scope.\nApplication layer measurement configuration received by the gNB from OAM or 5GC is encapsulated in a transparent container, which is forwarded to a UE as Application layer configuration in the RRCReconfiguration message (there can be multiple configurations in the same message). Application layer measurement reports received from UE's application layer are encapsulated in a transparent container and sent to the network in the MeasurementReportAppLayer message, as specified in TS 38.331 [12]. The UE can send multiple application layer measurement reports to the gNB in one MeasurementReportAppLayer message. In order to allow the transmission of application layer measurement reports which exceed the maximum PDCP SDU size, segmentation of the MeasurementReportAppLayer message may be enabled by the gNB.

Most of the MBMS control information is provided on a logical channel specific for MBMS common control information: the MCCH. E-UTRA employs one MCCH logical channel per MBSFN area. In case the network configures multiple MBSFN areas, the UE acquires the MBMS control information from the MCCHs that are configured to identify if services it is interested to receive are ongoing. The action applicable when the UE is unable to simultaneously receive MBMS and unicast services is up to UE implementation. In this release of the specification, an MBMS capable UE is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service at a time, and reception of more than one MBMS service (also possibly on more than one MBSFN area) in parallel is left for UE implementation. The MCCH carries the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message, which indicates the MBMS sessions that are ongoing as well as the (corresponding) radio resource configuration. The MCCH may also carry the MBMSCountingRequest message, when E-UTRAN wishes to count the number of UEs in RRC_CONNECTED that are receiving or interested to receive one or more specific MBMS services.\n\n5.8.1.3\tMCCH information validity and notification of changes\nChange of MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the same MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by means of SystemInformationBlockType13.\nWhen the network changes (some of) the MCCH information, it notifies the UEs about the change during a first modification period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated MCCH information. These general principles are illustrated in figure 5.8.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate different MCCH information. Upon receiving a change notification, a UE interested to receive MBMS services acquires the new MCCH information immediately from the start of the next modification period. The UE applies the previously acquired MCCH information until the UE acquires the new MCCH information.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('How are MCCH transmissions and associated radio resources indicated to the UE?

The fields that are compressed (i.e. removed from the Ethernet header) by the EHC protocol are: DESTINATION ADDRESS, SOURCE ADDRESS, 802.1Q TAG, and LENGTH/TYPE. The fields PREAMBLE, SFD, and FCS are not transmitted in 3GPP system, and thus not considered in EHC protocol. There may be more than one 802.1Q TAG fields in the Ethernet header, and all are compressed by the EHC protocol.

Each EHC context is identified by a unique identifier, called Context ID (CID). The EHC context must be synchronized between the EHC compressor and the EHC decompressor; otherwise, the EHC decompressor erroneously decompresses the \"Compressed Header (CH)\" packets.\n\nFor Ethernet header compression, Ethernet Header Compression (EHC) protocol specified in 3GPP TS 38.323 [29] is used.

All traffic on that cell is expected to be drained to other overlaid/umbrella candidate cells before the cell moves to energySaving state.\nSimilarly, when a network element or network function is in energy saving state it may need candidate network elements or network functions to pick up the load. For example, during off-peak traffic periods, one or more edge UPFs in energySaving state should not cause undue load on the other UPFs, all remaining traffic on those edge UPFs is expected to be redirected to other UPFs before the edge UPFs move into energySaving state.\n\nFor the centralized energy saving, MnS producer collects the traffic load performance measurements from the NR capacity booster cell and candidate cells, and may request a NR capacity booster cell to enter the energy saving mode when its traffic is below certain threshold. The NR capacity booster may initiate handover actions to off-load the traffic to the neighbouring cells (see clause 15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]) prior to entering into the energy saving mode.\n5.1.3.2.3\tInter-RAT energy saving \nInter-RAT energy saving focuses on a scenario where the LTE eNB provides basic coverage, with the gNB providing the capacity booster that can be switched off, based on its own cell load information or by MnS producer(s). The LTE eNB is allowed to activate the dormant capacity booster NR cell (see clause 5.6 in TR 37.816 [14]). \nInter-RAT energy saving consists of centralized energy saving where the energy saving decision is made in MnS producer.

This continuous monitoring of the PDCCH forces users to stay in active mode even when there is no traffic to be scheduled, thus resulting in unnecessary power consumption. To mitigate this problem, 5G defines UE power saving schemes including Connected mode DRX (CDRX) and PDCCH monitoring adaptation (e.g. PDCCH skipping and Search Space Set Group switching). Both CDRX and PDCCH monitoring adaptation offer the possibility to reduce UE power consumption by alternating between active and sleep periods, by switching the monitoring frequency of PDCCH, and/or by skipping some of the PDCCH monitoring occasions.\nUE power saving schemes can be optimally configured according to the traffic characteristics of XR traffic described above to guarantee the delivering of a packet within the PDB and at the same time maximize the power saving gain. Therefore, UE power saving scheme would benefit from application awareness in the form of additional information either carried over the user plane or new assistance information delivered using the control plane.\n\nUE power saving can also be achieved through PDCCH skipping mechanism when PDCCH skipping duration configuration is configured. UE can be indicated to skip PDCCH monitoring for a duration, starting from next slot after the indication, and shall resume PDCCH monitoring after the indicated duration. For Rel-17, UE can be configured with up to 3 skipping durations. In the following cases, UE ignores PDCCH skipping: \n-\ton all serving cells of the corresponding Cell Group when SR is sent and is pending;\n-\ton SpCell while contention resolution timer is running;\n-\ton SpCell during monitoring of the RAR/MsgB window.\nUE can be configured with both Rel-17 SSSG configuration and PDCCH skipping durations. In this case, UE performs either SSSG switching or PDCCH skipping based on the PDCCH monitoring adaptation indication field in a detected DCI format 0_1/0_2/1_1/1_2.\nRelaxation of UE measurements for RLM and/or BFD in connected mode\nUE power saving can be enabled by UE relaxing measurements for RLM/BFD. When configured, UE determines whether its serving cell radio link quality is better than a threshold and, if criterion is configured, whether it is in low mobility state. The configuration for good serving cell quality criterion and, if included, low mobility criterion is provided through dedicated signalling.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which power saving scheme can potentially reduce the UE power consumption by reducing the number of PDCCH blind decoding?

All features are optional for the UE and can be supported by Cat-M1 and Cat-M2 and by normal LTE UEs supporting CE mode unless otherwise stated. All features are applicable to both CE modes (A and B) in all duplex modes (HD-FDD, FD-FDD, and TDD) unless otherwise stated.\nImproved DL transmission efficiency and UE power consumption\nReduced UE power consumption is achieved through reduced downlink monitoring and reduced signalling, building on features introduced in earlier releases.\n\u2022\tUE-group wake-up signals (GWUS): Reduced UE power consumption in idle mode was enabled in Rel-15 by the introduction of the wake-up signal (WUS), a compact signal transmitted a configurable time before the paging occasion (PO) when a UE is being paged, allowing the UE to maximize its sleep time during periods when there is no paging. In Rel-16, an enhancement is introduced that allows a WUS to wake up a configurable group of UEs rather than all UEs that happen to monitor the same PO. This helps reduce the power consumption even further.

This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the network allows for the UE to 'wake up' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing much of the UE's conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.\n\n7.2\tAdditional enhancements for NB-IoT\nSummary based on the input provided by FUTUREWEI in RP-201229.\nThis Feature builds on the successful base NB-IoT feature in Rel-13, and enhancements in Rel-14 and Rel-15, and adds features such as DL/UL transmission efficiency improvement, UE power consumption improvement, scheduling enhancement, network management tool enhancement, latency improvement, enhancement on coexistence with NR and connection to 5GC. \nImproved DL transmission efficiency and UE power consumption \nReduced UE power consumption and improved transmission efficiency are achieved through reduced downlink monitoring and reduced signalling, building on features introduced in earlier releases.\nUE-group wake-up signals (GWUS) (FDD): \nWith the introduction of Rel-15 wake-up signalling (WUS), UE can skip the paging procedures if the wake-up signal is not detected to save power.

There are three typical traffic classes or communication patterns in industrial environments [6], i.e.,\n-\tdeterministic periodic communication: periodic communication with stringent requirements on timeliness of the transmission. \n-\tdeterministic aperiodic communication: communication without a preset sending time. Typical activity patterns for which this kind of communication is suitable are event-driven actions.\n-\tnon-deterministic communication: subsumes all other types of traffic, including periodic non-real time and aperiodic non-real time traffic.

The policy can dictate whether the EAS can be relocated or not. If it can be relocated does it require prior notification to be sent to the authorized entities? The solution also requires relocation trigger information, decided by ECMS (ECSP Management System), to be included in EASFunction IOC. This information dictates whether EAS should be relocated immediately or at some future point of time. ECMS decides to relocate an EAS for any appropriate purpose e.g. the overload of an edge compute resource, a failure or planned maintenance, a new or expanded edge compute resource, an issue with the network for its edge compute resource. \nOnce decided to relocate the EAS, ECMS considers the relocation policy and trigger information. If the EAS is to be relocated immediately and the relocation policy allows it, ECMS selects the appropriate EDN and instantiate the relocation procedure. That will include instantiating the EAS on the selected EDN as specified in TS 28.538 [6] and then terminate the existing EAS instance. If the relocation policy states that a prior notification is to be provided ECMS notifies all authorized receivers using notifyMOIAttributeValueChange notification, against updates on relocation trigger information in EASFunction IOC, as specified in TS 28.532. The notification will be sent before instantiating the relocation procedure. The consumer can reject the relocation by updating the value of attribute RelocationRejectByConsumer to TRUE.\n\nIt is proposed to add the following in EASRequirements IOC\n-\tAttribute RelocationPolicy with allowed values as follows\n-\tYes: This dictates that an EAS can be relocated as and when required\n-\tNo: This dictates an EAS cannot be relocated at all\n-\tYesWNotify: This indicates that an EAS can be relocated with a prior notification \nThe solution also requires the following information to be included in the EASFunction IOC\n1)\tRelocationTriggerInfo\na)\tImmediateTrigger: It is a Boolean attribute with default value as FALSE.

In case the packet has not reached the destination, the IAB-node determines the next hop backhaul link, referred to as egress link, based on the BAP routing ID carried in the BAP header and a routing configuration it received from the IAB-donor-CU.\nFor each packet, the IAB-node further determines the egress BH RLC channel on the designated egress link. For packets arriving from upper layers, the designated egress BH RLC channel is configured by the IAB-donor-CU, and it is based on upper layer traffic specifiers. Since each BH RLC channel is configured with QoS information or priority level, BH-RLC-channel selection facilitates traffic-specific prioritization and QoS enforcement on the BH. For F1-U traffic, it is possible to map each GTP-U tunnel to a dedicated BH RLC channel or to aggregate multiple GTP-U tunnels into one common BH RLC channel.

A static PDN address or a static PDN GW address, if configured by HSS for an APN with LIPA permissions set to \"LIPA-conditional\", is ignored by MME when the APN is established as a LIPA PDN connection.

The 5G QoS characteristics is determined by the 5QI. This implies that each packet in a QoS flow is treated according to the same QoS requirements.\nFor XR/media services, a group of packets are used to carry payloads of a PDU Set (e.g. a frame, video slice/tile).\nIn media layer, packets in such a PDU Set are decoded/handled as a whole. For example, the frame/video slice may only be decoded in case all or certain amount of the packets carrying the frame/video slice are successfully delivered. For example, a frame within a GOP (Group of Pictures) can only be decoded by the client in case all frames on which that frame depends are successfully received. Hence the groups of packets within the PDU Set have inherent dependency on each other in media layer. Without considering such dependencies between the packets within the PDU set, 5GS may perform a scheduling with low efficiency. For example, the 5GS may randomly drop packet (s) but try to deliver other packets of the same PDU set which are useless to the client and thus waste radio resources.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What are the fundamental characteristics for QoS in the Streaming class?

The supported service types are:\n-\tQoE Measurement Collection for DASH streaming services;\n-\tQoE Measurement Collection for MTSI services;\n-\tQoE Measurement Collection for VR services.\nFor DASH, MTSI, VR, the QoE measurement collection is supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only, unless the application data is delivered via MBS broadcast communication service.\nThe QoE Measurement Collection function supports collection of QoE measurements for MBS communication service. The measurement collection is supported for the following two communication service types:\n-\tMBS broadcast;\n-\tMBS multicast.\nQoE measurement collection for application sessions delivered via MBS broadcast is supported in RRC_CONNECTED, RRC_INACTIVE, and RRC_IDLE states. QoE measurement collection for the application sessions delivered via MBS multicast is supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only. Both signalling based and management based QoE measurement collection are supported in NR SA and NR-DC. Further details of NR-DC operation can be found in TS 37.340 [21] and clause 21.7.\n\nThis function enables collection of application layer measurements from the UE. The supported service types are QoE Measurement Collection for streaming services and QoE Measurement Collection for MTSI services. The feature is activated by Trace Function from the MDT framework (see clause 19.2.1.17 and TS 37.320 [43]). Both signalling based and management based initiation cases are allowed. For the signalling based case, the Application Layer Measurement Collection is initiated towards a specific UE from CN nodes using the MDT mechanism as described in clause 5.1.3 of TS 37.320 [43]; for the management based case, the Application Layer Measurement Collection is initiated from OAM targeting an area (without targeting a specific UE).\nApplication layer measurement configuration received from OAM or CN is encapsulated in a transparent container, which is forwarded to UE in a downlink RRC message. Application layer measurements received from UE's higher layer are encapsulated in a transparent container and sent to network in an uplink RRC message, as specified in TS 36.331 [16].

Although MUST and the LTE Rel-12 Work Item Network-Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression (NAICS) both rely on receivers to perform interference cancellation, the latter targets the inter-cell interference and is typically used when the user is at the cell edge, while the former aims at the intra-cell interference.\nThe key functionalities of MUST are described as follows. A UE is signalled by RRC if it is to be configured for potential MUST operation. When a UE is higher-layer configured to have MUST, some bits are added into the downlink control information (DCI) as MUST assistance information. The UE monitors some bit field in the DCI to see whether MUST is enabled in a transmit time interval.\n\n23.9\tNetwork-assisted interference cancellation/suppression\nA UE that supports network assisted interference cancellation/suppression (NAICS) receiver functionality can mitigate PDSCH and CRS interference from aggressor cells in order to better receive a PDSCH from its serving cell.\nThe network may configure the UE with NAICS information of the aggressor cells in order to help the UE to mitigate the PDSCH and CRS interference of the aggressor cells. To support NAICS, an eNB may exchange NAICS information with its neighbour eNBs through X2 signalling.\n23.10\tSupport for sidelink communication\n23.10.1\tGeneral\nSidelink communication is a mode of communication whereby UEs can communicate with each other directly over the PC5 interface, as specified in TS 23.303 [62]. This communication mode is supported when the UE is served by E-UTRAN and when the UE is outside of E-UTRA coverage. Only those UEs authorised to be used for public safety operation can perform sidelink communication.\nIn order to perform synchronisation for out of coverage operation UE(s) may act as a synchronisation source by transmitting SBCCH and a synchronisation signal. SBCCH carries the most essential system\u00a0information needed to receive other sidelink channels and signals. SBCCH along with a synchronisation signal is transmitted with a fixed periodicity of 40ms. When the UE is in network coverage, the contents of SBCCH are derived from the parameters signalled by the eNB. When the UE is out of coverage, if the UE selects another UE\u00a0as a synchronisation reference, then the content of SBCCH is derived from the received SBCCH; otherwise UE uses pre-configured parameters. SIB18 provides the resource information for synchronisation signal and SBCCH transmission. There are two pre-configured subframes every 40ms for out of coverage operation. UE receives synchronisation signal and SBCCH in one subframe and transmit synchronisation signal and SBCCH on another subframe if UE becomes synchronisation source based on defined criterion, as specified in [16].\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which Work Item targets inter-cell interference cancellation in LTE?

Clause 4 described concepts, relevant terminologies, AI/ML workflow and the overall management capabilities. The AI/ML workflow highlights three main operational phases, namely training, deployment, and inference phase. Corresponding management capabilities were identified for each of the operational phases by considering a wide range of relevant use cases along with corresponding potential requirements and possible solutions as documented in clause 5. In this clause, around 52 use cases, along with their corresponding potential requirements and possible solutions have thus far been documented and grouped under 21 categories.\nThe present document has also discussed and documented number of deployment-scenarios involving the AI/ML related functionalities (e.g. NWDAF, RAN intelligence and MDAF) and the corresponding management capabilities.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which of the following principles apply when 5GS assists AI/ML operations in the application layer?

For an integrated fixed broadband / mobile residential 5G offering, it would be beneficial if devices behind an eRG can also be known and identified in the core network.\nThe trend towards Wireline / Wireless Convergence is already recognised in 3GPP.

At most possible occasions for paging, no message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the network allows for the UE to 'wake up' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing much of the UE's conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.\n\n5.4.9\tWake Up Signal Assistance\n5.4.9.1\tGeneral\nThe RAN and UE may use a Wake Up Signal (WUS) to reduce the UE's idle mode power consumption. The RAN sends the WUS shortly before the UE's paging occasion. The WUS feature enables UEs to determine that in the paging occasions immediately following their WUS occasion they will not be paged if their WUS is not transmitted, or that they might be paged if their WUS is transmitted (see TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[52]).\nTo avoid waking up UEs due to an AMF paging other UEs across multiple cells (e.g. due to frequent UE mobility and/or for low paging latency services such as VoLTE), the use of WUS by the ng-eNB and the UE is restricted to the last used cell, i.e. the cell in which the UE's RRC connection was last released.

The supported number of DL MIMO layers is the same as the implemented number of Rx branches, and as a result, 2-Rx RedCap UEs have twice as high DL peak rate as 1-Rx RedCap UEs. The UE indicates to gNB how many branches/layers it supports. The gNB can allow or disallow access from 1-Rx and 2-Rx RedCap UEs separately per cell.\n\u2022\tFor FR2, a RedCap UE can either support a legacy UE power class such as PC3 or the new lower UE power class PC7 (with a reduced-complexity reference UE Rx/Tx antenna configuration with either 1 panel with 4 elements or 2 panels with 2 elements each, corresponding to half the number of array elements compared to a legacy PC3 UE). Furthermore, the UE indicates support for 1 or 2 DL MIMO layers (independent of the antenna configuration).\nA RedCap UE in FDD mode can report per band whether it implements half-duplex FDD (HD-FDD) or full-duplex FDD (FD-FDD) support. In HD-FDD operation, the UE is not required to transmit and receive at the same time. The network indicates in SIB1 whether the cell supports HD-FDD RedCap UEs.\n\nA RedCap UE can be implemented with or without support for DL 256QAM in FR1. Compared to 64QAM (which is mandatory for RedCap UEs), 256QAM support increases the peak data rate by ~33%. Support for UL 256QAM in FR1 and DL/UL 256QAM in FR2 is also optional for RedCap UEs, but this is true even for legacy NR UEs.\nSome higher layer features are optional for RedCap UEs: RedCap UEs can optionally support 16 DRBs (as normal NR UEs) but only have mandatory support of 8 DRBs. RedCap UEs can optionally support 18-bit PDCP/RLC sequence numbers (as normal NR UEs) but only have mandatory support for 12-bit sequence numbers. RedCap UEs have optional (but not mandatory) support for automatic neighbour relation (ANR) functionality.\nDue to the reduced UE bandwidth, there are some modifications of the bandwidth part (BWP) operation. Separate initial DL/UL BWPs can be configured for random access for RedCap UEs, which may be required if one or both of the ordinary initial DL/UL BWPs in the cell are configured with a bandwidth which is wider than the maximum RedCap UE bandwidth (i.e., wider than 20 MHz in FR1 or wider than 100 MHz in FR2). A separate initial DL BWP can, but does not need to, contain SSB/CORESET#0/SIB.

As a consequence, substantial efforts are often required to introduce new services or simply to modify the existing one (customisation). This makes it more difficult for operators to differentiate their services. At the same time however, this may reduce the complexity of providing a service across different operators' networks.\n3GPP shall therefore preferentially standardise service capabilities. In circumstances where the service is meant to be used across different operators' networks, hence a common specification set is of paramount importance, the service should be standardised to a level of detail sufficient to ensure interoperability and interworking across different operators' networks. Service capabilities consist of bearers defined by QoS parameters and the mechanisms needed to realise services. These mechanisms include the functionality provided by various network elements, the communication between them and the storage of associated data. This TS provides a conceptual description of a service architecture and architecture requirements which aim to provide service capabilities. It is intended that these standardised capabilities should provide a defined platform which will enable the support of speech, video, multi-media, messaging, data, teleservices, user applications and supplementary services and enable the market for services to be determined by users and home environments.\n\n5.2\tProvision and evolution of services\nSince a phased approach has been adopted, the same general service principles shall apply to each phase. Support of services from an end user perspective is understood to be an important driver for established mobile users to stay with their existing operator while taking the new services into use.

Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.\nFor a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.\nA connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.\nEarly data transmission (FDD)\nAn idle mode UE is able to transmit data in Msg3 of the random access procedure, carrying between 328 and 1000 bits. After successful reception by eNB, the random access procedure terminates and the UE does not transition to connected mode. The UE requests a grant for EDT if its pending data is smaller than a maximum permitted size configured by eNB, by using a pre-configured set of NPRACH resources for its preamble transmission. The eNB can allow the UE to transmit a smaller amount of data than the maximum permitted size, in order to reduce the power spent transmitting padding bits.\n\n7.1\tImprovements of Machine-Type of Communications (MTC) and Internet of Things (IoT)\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-180851 revised in RP-181838.\nThis work item is a collection of additions and enhancements of functionalities related to NB-IoT, primarily focusing on reducing UE power consumption and on enhancing the parts of the Rel-13/14 NB-IoT air interface and protocol layers to respond to feedback from early deployments.\nAdditional new features include support for small cells, extensions to NB-IoT standalone operation mode, and TDD.\nWake-up signalling for IDLE mode (FDD)\nWhen a UE is in DRX or eDRX, it has to regularly check if a paging message is arriving from the core network. At most possible occasions for paging, no message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the network allows for the UE to 'wake up' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing much of the UE's conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What does the Scheduling request feature in NB-IoT allow a connected mode UE to do?

In addition, it supports blind re-transmission schemes, which are described in clauses 6.3.2.1 and 6.3.2.2 on resource allocation modes 1 and 2, respectively.\nWhen ACK/NACK (or DTX) operation is used, the sidelink HARQ procedure is similar to the Uu scheme for non-codeblock group feedback, i.e. the HARQ feedback is transmitted based on the success or failure of the whole transport block.\nNACK-only operation is defined for groupcast to allow a potentially lower sidelink resource demand to be created when a larger number of Rx UEs need to send feedback to the same Tx UE. A typical use case is an extended sensors scenario where UEs within a given radius all receive the same sensor information from the Tx UE, and re-transmission will occur if any UE fails to decode successfully. Since such information may only be relevant within a given radius around the Tx UE (e.g. a few tens or hundreds of meters around a road junction), the transmission of NACK-only feedback can be restricted to UEs within such a radius, and any UE beyond it does not provide any HARQ feedback.

The transmission of NACK-only feedback can be restricted to UEs within given a radius, and any UE beyond it does not provide any HARQ-ACK.

The CPN via an eRG, or PIN Elements via a PIN Element with Gateway Capability can provide access to 5G network services for the UEs and/or non-3GPP devices on the CPN or PIN. CPNs and PINs have in common that in general they are owned, installed and/or (at least partially) configured by a customer of a public network operator. \nA Customer Premises Network (CPN) is a network located within a premises (e.g. a residence, office or shop). Via an evolved Residential Gateway (eRG), the CPN provides connectivity to the 5G network. The eRG can be connected to the 5G core network via wireline, wireless, or hybrid access. A Premises Radio Access Station (PRAS) is a base station installed in a CPN. Through the PRAS, UEs can get access to the CPN and/or 5G network services. The PRAS can be configured to use licensed, unlicensed, or both frequency bands. Connectivity between the eRG and the UE, non-3GPP Device, or PRAS can use any suitable non-3GPP technology (e.g. Ethernet, optical, WLAN).\n\n5.18\tControl of Customer Premises Network by Authorised Administrator\n5.18.1\tDescription\nThe Customer Premises Network (CPN), including the eRG and PRAS, is at least owned, configured and managed by the customer of a public network operator. This implies that the public network operator is at least not fully in control of the configuration and management of the eRG, PRAS and CPN.\nSome aspects of the eRG and PRAS can be under control of the public network operator. For example if the PRAS uses licensed frequencies the radio configuration will be under control of the PLMN. Another example could be network settings in the eRG for the interface to the 5G core network.\nOther settings are configured / managed by the 'customer of the public network operator'. It is proposed to specify more clearly how this configuration and management by the 'customer of the public network operator' works. We are proposing to define the role of an Authorized Administrator. The Authorized Administrator may be authorized to configure / manage a specific node (e.g. a specific PRAS, eRG), or may be authorized to configure / manage a specific customer premises network (including one or more eRGs and/or PRASs).\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is a Customer Premises Network (CPN)?

The NG-RAN location reporting may be used by the AMF when the target UE is in CM-CONNECTED state. The NG-RAN location reporting may be used by the AMF to determine the geographically located TAI in the case of NR satellite access.\nThe AMF may request the NG-RAN location reporting with event reporting type (e.g. UE location or UE presence in Area of Interest), reporting mode and its related parameters (e.g. number of reporting).\nIf the AMF requests UE location, the NG-RAN reports the current UE location (or last known UE location with time stamp if the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state) based on the requested reporting parameter (e.g. one-time reporting or continuous reporting).\nIf the AMF requests UE location, in the case of NR satellite access, the NG-RAN provides all broadcast TAIs to the AMF as part of the ULI.

If the Reporting Type indicates to report whenever the UE changes cell and if PScell reporting is requested and Dual Connectivity is in use, the Master RAN node shall also report to the AMF whenever the PSCell changes. If the Reporting Type indicates to start the NG-RAN to report when UE moves out of or into the Area Of Interest, the AMF also provides the requested Area Of Interest information in the Location Reporting Control message.

This chargeable event is then mapped to an appropriate charging event, resulting in a single CDR or in a single Credit-Control and resource usage authorisation procedure. In contrast, session based charging is characterised by the existence of a user session, such as a circuit call, an IP CAN bearer, an PDU session, or an IMS session. This user session is then matched by a charging session, resulting in the generation of multiple chargeable/charging events and the creation of one or more CDRs in offline charging/converged charging or the performance of a Credit-Control session in online charging/converged charging.

Each line of the configuration file contains the values of p and o separated by a space.\nThe channel-aware configuration file is meant to simulate channel feedback from a receiver to a sender, i.e. the decoder would generate FEC indication and FEC offset values for receiver feedback that correspond to the current transmission channel characteristics, thereby allowing optimization of the transmission by the encoder which applies the FEC offset and FEC indication when in the channel-aware mode. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of the EVS Floating-point Conformance for Non Bit-Exact work item?

MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio resources and MCS) are indicated via the PDCCH addressed to Multicast MCCH-RNTI. PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for the multicast MCCH transmission are determined according to the common search space indicated by searchspaceMulticastMCCH. If searchspaceMulticastMCCH is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for the multicast MCCH message reception in the multicast MCCH transmission window are the same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213 [13]. If searchspaceMulticastMCCH is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for the multicast MCCH message are determined based on search space indicated by searchspaceMulticastMCCH. PDCCH monitoring occasions for the multicast MCCH message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the multicast MCCH transmission window. The [x\u00d7N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion for the multicast MCCH message in the multicast MCCH transmission window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, \u2026N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in multicast MCCH transmission window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the multicast MCCH transmission window, PDCCH for a multicast MCCH message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception multicast MCCH messages is up to UE implementation.\n\nWhen SearchSpaceId = 0 is configured for pei-SearchSpace, the UE monitors the PEI-O according to searchSpaceZero. When SearchSpaceId other than 0 is configured for pei-SearchSpace, the UE monitors the PEI-O according to the search space with the configured SearchSpaceId.\nA PEI occasion is a set of 'S*X' consecutive PDCCH MOs, where 'S' is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1, and X is the nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO if configured or is equal to 1 otherwise.

For GPRS there are the following components to track: GGSN address (ggsn parameter), media authorization token (auth token parameter), and a pdp-info parameter that contains the information for one or more PDP contexts. In this release the media authorization token is set to zero. The pdp-info contains one or more pdp-item values followed by a collection of parameters (pdp-sig, gcid, and flow-id). The value of the pdp-item is a unique number that identifies each of the PDP-related charging information within the P-Charging-Vector header field. Each PDP context has an indicator if it is an IM CN subsystem signalling PDP context (pdp-sig parameter), an associated GPRS Charging Identifier (gcid parameter), and a identifier (flow-id parameter). The flow-id parameter contains a sequence of curly bracket delimited flow identifier tuples that identify associated m-lines and relative order of port numbers in an m-line within the SDP from the SIP signalling to which the PDP context charging information applies.

These include transport volume and measurements of a UEs radio environment.\nUplink buffer status reports (BSR) are needed to provide support for QoS-aware packet scheduling. In E-UTRAN uplink buffer status reports refer to the data that is buffered in for a group of logical channel (LCG) in the UE. Four LCGs and two formats are used for reporting in uplink:\n-\tA short format for which only one BSR (of one LCG) is reported;\n-\tA long format for which all four BSRs (of all four LCGs) are reported.\nUplink buffer status reports are transmitted using MAC signalling.\nIn DC, LCG is configured per CG.\nIn DC, BSR configuration, triggering and reporting are independently performed per CG. For split bearers, the PDCP data is considered in BSR in the CG(s) configured by RRC.For LWA bearers in the UL, the bearers configured to use WLAN only do not trigger BSR. For bearers configured to use WLAN and LTE, only the data that may be sent over LTE (i.e., excluding UL data already sent or decided to be sent over WLAN) is considered for BSR.\n\n-\tAn extended short format to report one BSR (of one LCG);\n-\tAn extended long format to report several BSRs (up to all 256 LCGs).\nNOTE:\tThe Extended versions of the BSR formats can only be used by IAB nodes.\nUplink buffer status reports are transmitted using MAC signalling. When a BSR is triggered (e.g. when new data arrives in the transmission buffers of the UE), a Scheduling Request (SR) can be transmitted by the UE (e.g. when no resources are available to transmit the BSR).\nFor IAB, the Pre-emptive BSR can be configured on the backhaul links. The Pre-emptive BSR is sent based on expected data rather than buffered data, as described in clause 4.7.3.3.\nPower headroom reports (PHR) are needed to provide support for power-aware packet scheduling. In NR, three types of reporting are supported: a first one for PUSCH transmission, a second one for PUSCH and PUCCH transmission in an LTE Cell Group in EN-DC (see TS 37.340 [21]) and a third one for SRS transmission on SCells configured with SRS only. In case of CA, when no transmission takes place on an activated SCell, a reference power is used to provide a virtual report. To allow network to detect UL power reduction, the PHR reports may also contain Power Management Maximum Power Reduction (P-MPR, see TS 38.101-2 [35]) information that UE uses to ensure UE compliance with the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) exposure regulation for FR2, which is set for limiting RF exposure on human body.

The TRS in TRS occasions may allow UEs in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE to sleep longer before waking-up for its paging occasion. The TRS occasions configuration is provided in SIB17. The availability of TRS in the TRS occasions is indicated by L1 availability indication. These TRSs may also be used by the UEs configured with eDRX.\nUE power saving may be achieved by UE relaxing measurements for RLM/BFD. When configured, UE determines whether it is in low mobility state and/or whether its serving cell radio link quality is better than a threshold. The configuration for low mobility and good serving cell quality criterion is provided through dedicated RRC signalling.\nRLM and BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled separately through RRC Configuration. Additionally, RLM relaxation may be enabled/disabled on per Cell Group basis while BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled on per serving cell basis.\n\n7.3.1\tRRC_IDLE/INACTIVE mode\n7.3.1.1\tRRC_IDLE/INACTIVE mode procedures \nIn RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states, UEs shall perform RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE mode procedures defined in TS 38.304 and TS 38.331, which specify how UEs shall monitor paging, keep system information up to date, receive ETWS/CMAS information, and perform RRM measurements and corresponding cell selection/re-selection to ensure that UE is camping on the best cell. These procedures may need to be modified to accommodate operation using LP-WUS/WUR. \nThough the network may use different signals to page UE for the case that UE monitors LP-WUS and the case that UE doesn't monitor LP-WUS, the network doesn't need to be aware of whether the UE is monitoring LP-WUS or not in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE. Otherwise, it requires the UE to switch on MR or wake up MR to inform the network whether the UE is monitoring LP-WUS or not, which leads to further signalling overhead, Uu resource consumption and also UE power consumption accordingly. \nWith LP-WUS/WUR, the Main Receiver (MR) of a UE could enter ultra-deep sleep state, which denotes a state when the MR may sleep or turn off. Such ultra-deep sleep state could be entered when predefined condition (e.g. quality of LP-SS and/or SSB is better than the threshold) is fulfilled. An operation like the one for Mobile Initiated Communication Only (MICO), where both monitoring of the downlink and RRM measurements are stopped until there is a subsequent uplink transmission, is however not feasible for LP-WUS/WUR. Thhe point with LP-WUS/WUR is to reduce UE power consumption while maintaining some downlink monitoring functionality, and this is not possible if either the UE stops monitoring in downlink or if the UE does not detect that it has moved into a new cell/area and therefore apply the incorrect configuration for downlink monitoring. According to TS 38.300, the functionality to be supported over Uu interface in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE includes PLMN selection, SI reception, cell re-selection mobility, and paging, etc. Therefore, it is feasible to introduce LP-WUS/WUR as a power saving feature for RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE, while ultra-deep sleep state as a power saving state for RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('How can UE power saving be achieved in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE?

Using AKMA, a user can log in to an application service only based on the 3GPP credential which is the permanent key stored in the user\u2019s tamper-resistant smart card UICC. The application service provider can also delegate the task of user authentication to the mobile network operator by using AKMA. \nThe AKMA architecture and procedures are specified by SA3 in TS 33.535 [1], with the related study showing how its general principles are derived documented in TR 33.835 [2]. The AKMA feature introduces a new Network Function into the 5G system, which is the AKMA Anchor Function (AAnF). Its detailed services and API definitions are specified by CT3 in TS 29.535[3]. Earlier generations of cellular networks include two similar standards specified by SA3, which are generic bootstrapping architecture (GBA) and battery-efficient security for very low throughput machine type communication devices (BEST).

Rel-16 URLLC work in 5GS is limited to URSP solutions assuming that the UE's application layer or operating system supports duplication of the traffic and provides two distinct traffic descriptors for the two redundant traffic. How to initiate the establishment procedure and how to use the redundant user plane path are not defined yet (now they are up to the upper layer implementation). For example, the UE may use the implementation of FRER (Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability), IEEE\u00a0802.1CB-2017\u00a0[14], in the UE's upper layer protocols (i.e. application layer or operating system layer), to establish two redundant PDU Sessions and manage the replication and elimination of redundant packets/frames. However, redundant implementation on upper layer protocols is not always available for application clients and application servers. In those cases where application client and application server support is not available for redundant implementation, the application enablement layer (with SEALDD client and SEALDD server) can support this functionality for the application. For the verticals/enterprises, it is a better choice to use the SEALDD service for the interaction with 5GC and management of the replication and elimination of redundant packets so as to remove the complication from the application. \n\n6.49\tSolution #49: NWDAF assisted URSP decision for redundant transmission\n6.49.1\tDescription\nThe solution addresses the key issue #6 \"NWDAF-assisted URSP\".\nApart from redundant transmission at transport layer, two redundant mechanisms are defined to provide redundant transmission for URLLC services since Rel-16: a) Dual Connectivity based end to end Redundant User Plane Paths; b) Redundant Transmission on N3/N9 interface.

The solutions that have been specified include:\n-\tSemi-static CFI configuration\n-\tPDSCH repetition\n-\tUL SPS repetition\n-\tPDCP packet duplication\n-\tGranular time reference provision.\nThese solutions support configurable reliability and latency combinations and have been specified on top of the existing LTE air interface for Frame Structure type 1 (FS1) and Frame Structure type 2 (FS2), including various LTE TTI lengths (1ms, slot and subslot for FS1, 1ms and slot for FS2) as well as existing LTE latency reduction techniques.\nAn overview of the specified solutions is provided in the following.\nSemi-static CFI\nControl Format Indicator (CFI) indicates how many OFDM symbols are used for the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.\n\n-\tSemistatic CFI: A semistatic value for CFI (which determines the number of symbols to be used for PDCCH in a given subframe) is indicated in MIB. This allows the UE to skip PCFICH decoding, which can become the bottleneck in low SINR conditions.\n-\tAggregation level 16: Before Rel-16, the maximum aggregation level for PDCCH was 8. Rel-16 introduces aggregation level 16 (only for MBMS dedicated cells) to enhance performance in low SINR conditions.\n-\tPBCH repetition: Similar to the scheme defined for eMTC (but with additional symbol-level rotation for interference randomization), PBCH is repeated in CAS.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in: \nhttps://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=830076,800091,830176,830276 \n[1]\tRP-193050: \u201cRevised WID on LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast\u201d, RAN#86\n[2] \tRP-160675, \u201cNew WID: eMBMS enhancements for LTE\u201d\n[3] \tTR\u00a038.913: \"Study on scenarios and requirements for next generation access technologies\"\n[4]\tTR\u00a036.776: \u201cEvolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Study on LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast\u201d\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What does CFI stand for in the context of LTE_HRLLC?

As a result, the power consumption caused by unnecessary PDCCH monitoring is unavoidable. The gain for legacy UE power saving features in RRC_CONNECTED, such as Short C-DRX, Long C-DRX, Rel-16 PDCCH-based WUS, or Rel-17 PDCCH monitor adaptation, comes from reducing the PDCCH monitoring time. \nBoth Rel-16 DCP and Rel-17 PDCCH monitor adaptation are both PDCCH based signalling. For a UE equipped with LR, the MR can be in a sleep state while the LR remains active to monitor Low-Power Wake-Up Signal (LP-WUS), and when LP-WUS is received by LR, it will trigger the MR to wake up to monitor PDCCH. As LR would adopt a minimalistic design, the power consumption of LR is expected to be significantly lower than legacy PDCCH based signaling using the main receiver (MR) in some cases. In this way, LP-WUS in RRC_CONNECTED can potentially further reduce the UE energy consumption by being able the monitor the downlink with a LR such that the MR used for PDCCH monitoring can be kept in a sleep state. The LP-WUS/WUR solution should target power saving gain compared to the existing Rel-15/16/17 UE power saving mechanisms, e.g., according to the evaluation results above, {6%~15%} additional UE power saving gain with no capacity loss in both low load and high load cases for DL only XR traffic compared to the existing Rel-15/16/17 power saving solutions. \n\nNOTE 1:\tA PO associated with a PF may start in the PF or after the PF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PDCCH monitoring occasions for a PO can span multiple radio frames.

A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted.\nA remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID. Consequently, each gNB can be an aggressor and a victim at the same time.\n\nIn both frameworks, upon realizing that the atmospheric ducting has disappeared, the victim gNBs stop transmitting the RIM reference signal.\n17.2\tCross-Link Interference Management\nWhen different TDD DL/UL patterns are used between neighbouring cells, UL transmission in one cell may interfere with DL reception in another cell: this is referred to as Cross Link Interference (CLI).\nTo mitigate CLI, gNBs can exchange and coordinate their intended TDD DL-UL configurations over Xn and F1 interfaces; and the victim UEs can be configured to perform CLI measurements. There are two types of CLI measurements:\n-\tSRS-RSRP measurement in which the UE measures SRS-RSRP over SRS resources of aggressor UE(s);\n-\tCLI-RSSI measurement in which the UE measures the total received power observed over RSSI resources.\nLayer 3 filtering applies to CLI measurement results and both event triggered and periodic reporting are supported.\n18\tSmall Data Transmission\n18.0\tGeneral\nSmall Data Transmission (SDT) is a procedure allowing data and/or signalling transmission while remaining in RRC_INACTIVE state (i.e. without transitioning to RRC_CONNECTED state). SDT is enabled on a radio bearer basis and can be initiated either by the UE in case of MO-SDT (Mobile Originated SDT) or by the network in case of MT-SDT (Mobile Terminated SDT). MO-SDT is initiated by the UE only if less than or equal to a configured amount of UL data awaits transmission across all radio bearers for which SDT is enabled, the DL RSRP is above a configured threshold, and a valid SDT resource is available as specified in clause 5.27.1 of TS 38.321 [6]. MT-SDT is initiated by the network with an indication to the UE in a paging message when DL data awaits transmission for radio bearers configured for SDT; based on the indication, the UE initiates the MT-SDT only if the DL RSRP is above a configured threshold as specified in clause 5.27.1 of TS 38.321 [6]. When MT-SDT is initiated by the UE, a resume cause indicating MT-SDT is included in the RRCResumeRequest/RRCResumeRequest1. Maximum duration the SDT procedure can last is dictated by a SDT failure detection timer that is configured by the network (see clause 6.2.2 of TS 38.331 [12]). Network can enable MO-SDT, MT-SDT, or both in a cell.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the term for the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells due to atmospheric ducting?

After GMM context establishment, SM uses services offered by GMM (see 3GPP\u00a0TS 24.007 [20]).

Requirements for industrial automation and URLLC (e.g. in TS 22.104) are extremely high and appropriate for connectivity for Smart Energy. However, network incidents could happen and the scenario in use case below may mitigate the impact of such a failure to further increase the system reliability.\nIt is important to emphasize that this use case is not theoretical. There are many substations around the world that use 3GPP access for communication services in more or less ad hoc fashion (where management interfaces between the 3GPP system and the DSO are not standardized.) This use case focusses on how 5G can provide service to DSOs as well.\nA DSO has many, e.g. 100s to 10,000s of substations. These substations are managed from operation centers typically referred to as control centers. \nFigure 5.7.1-1: Remote DSO management of connectivity for Smart Energy\nWithin the substation there are many services (shown here remote metering, automation, MV supervision, LV supervision, etc.) In addition, there are power line communication links beyond, to customer premises equipment, that increasingly will spread the reach of IP services up to the smart meters. The thick red line represents the termination of communication outside the substation. For 3GPP telecommunication services supporting the DSO, the model of the interface between the switch and the network can be considered a 5GLAN service.\n\n5.3.1\tDescription\n5.3.1.0\tGeneral\nAs a new service deployed in 5G, URLLC is significantly different from traditional eMBB service in terms of service requirement. In order to guarantee the performance of URLLC, the performance of 5G network which provides URLLC service needs to meet certain target for reliability accordingly. \nAnnex F in TS 22.104 [2] depicts relation of reliability and communication service availability. It has the following description, \"Communication service availability addresses the availability of a communication service. This definition follows the vertical standard IEC 61907 [7]. On the other hand, reliability is a 3GPP term and addresses the availability of a communication network.\"\nThe issue mainly focuses on the 5G RAN network that provides URLLC service. In particular, the measurements on communication network performance need to be investigated.\n5.3.1.1\tSupport for network performance on reliability in RAN\nReliability is a typical network performance measurement used to evaluate whether the 5G network which provides URLLC services meets the corresponding performance requirements. As for 5G network, it is the radio network including air interface that mainly restricts the reliability and latency performance. Therefore, more attentions should be paid to the reliability and latency performance measurement for radio network from the perspective management. However, the reliability performance measurements for radio network are not totally enough.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the expected reliability for remote control for process automation in 5G?

A method of dynamic subscription generation and management is needed in addition to statically provisioned subscription.

For the 3 MHz channel bandwidth, the PBCH is further equally punctured from both edges to span 144 subcarriers. The possible time locations of SSBs within a half-frame are determined by sub-carrier spacing and the periodicity of the half-frames where SSBs are transmitted is configured by the network. During a half-frame, different SSBs may be transmitted in different spatial directions (i.e. using different beams, spanning the coverage area of a cell).\nWithin the frequency span of a carrier, multiple SSBs can be transmitted. The PCIs of SSBs transmitted in different frequency locations do not have to be unique, i.e. different SSBs in the frequency domain can have different PCIs. However, when an SSB is associated with an RMSI, the SSB is referred to as a Cell-Defining SSB (CD-SSB).

This solution also resolves the Key Issue #2 to support satellite edge computing via PSA UPF on board.\nFor the case a UE communicates with another UE directly via 5GC without preconfigured VN Group association, e.g. via point-to-point application and protocols, the existing 5G LAN local switch cannot be reused. In this case, especially for the scenario that UPF is deployed on GEO satellite with gNB on the ground, on-board local data switch would be very beneficial to reduce end-to-end latency. This solution proposes a UPF-level session based approach to support local data switch.\nIn this solution, the on-board UPF is a PSA UPF and it is assumed that a single SMF is used. UE establishes a PDU Session with the GEO UPF acting as PSA.\nUE initiates PDU Session Establishment procedure based on URSP rules and sends DNN/S-NSSAI to AMF as described in clause\u00a04.3.2 of TS\u00a023.502\u00a0[3]. SMF selects GEO UPF as the PDU Session anchor based on the DNN/S-NSSAI sent by AMF. PCF determines the URSP rules based on GEO satellite backhaul category from AMF and send it to the UE including DNN/S-NSSAI for services deployed in GEO satellite or UE-to-UE services. The N4 rules of the UPF-level session applies to the DNN/S-NSSAI.\n\nFor the Session Breakout connectivity model, based on agreement with the operator, a possible solution for the service scheduling server is as follows:\n-\tThe IP address of the service scheduling server can be set as a condition in the ULCL UPF to offload traffic. The IP address of service scheduling server can be pre-configured or resolved by the EASDF based on procedure defined in clause\u00a06.2.2.2.\n-\tNAT server can be deployed in the L- DN or local N6 interface, in order that the source IP address of the UE request sent to the service scheduling server can correspond to the UE location related information.\nNOTE:\tOtherwise, the source IP address of the UE request message sent to the third party DNS server / service scheduling server is bound with the central PSA UPF, so it's impossible for the third party DNS server / service scheduling server to know which local EAS address could be allocated to the UE.\nBased on the mapping relationship between the IP ranges of UE request and the EAS information, the EAS IP address can be allocated to the UE.

This may be done by PDU Session re-establishment using SSC mode 2/3 mechanisms or Local PSA UPF relocation using UL CL and BP mechanisms. The corresponding procedures are defined in TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[2] and TS\u00a023.502\u00a0[3].\nDue to Edge Relocation, the UE may need to re-discover a new EAS and establish the connectivity to the new EAS to continue the service.

The EAS relocation may be due to AF internal triggers e.g. EAS load balance or maintenance, etc. or due to UP path change notification from SMF. The EAS relocation may include AF change or AF not change. The EAS relocation can happen with or without DNAI change. The AF may include the following information: Indication for EAS Relocation, target DNAI, traffic descriptor information and N6 routing information at target DNAI in the Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create/Update Request to the NEF, or Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create/Update Request to the PCF. When the PCF receives an AF request for the same application, then the latest AF request message take precedence over any previous request if the traffic descriptor information is same.\nThe AF may invoke the AF request targeting a set of UEs as described in clause\u00a04.3.6.2 of TS\u00a023.502\u00a0[3], due to change of common EAS/common DNAI used by the set of UEs.

For example, a transmission occurs every 15 ms. Reasons for a periodical transmission can be the periodic update of a position or the repeated monitoring of a characteristic parameter. Most periodic intervals in communication for automation are rather short. The transmission is started once and continuous unless a stop command is provided.\nAn aperiodic transmission is, for example, a transmission which is triggered instantaneously by an event, i.e., events are the trigger of the transmission. Events are defined by the control system or by the user. Example events are:\n-\tProcess events: events that come from the process when thresholds are exceeded or fallen below, e.g., temperature, pressure, level, etc.\n-\tDiagnostic events: events that indicate malfunctions of an automation device or module, e.g., power supply defective; short circuit; too high temperature; etc.\n\nIn order for the automation application system to operate, messages need to be exchanged between spatially distributed application functions. For that process, messages are exchanged at an interface between the automation application system and the communication system. This interface is termed the reference interface. Required and guaranteed values for characteristic parameters, which describe the behavioural properties of the radio communication system, as well as some influence quantities refer to that interface.\nThe conditions that influence the behaviour of wireless communication are framed by the communication requirements of the application (e.g., end-to-end latency), the characteristics of the communication system (e.g., output power of a transmitter), and the transmission conditions of the media (e.g., signal fluctuations caused by multipath propagation). \nGeneral requirements from the application point of view for the time and failure behaviour of a communication system are mostly related to an end-to-end link. It is assumed in the present document that the behaviour of the link is representative of the communication system as a whole and of the entire scope of the application. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What are the communication attributes in automation?

Typically, numerous wireless devices such as microphones, in-ear monitoring systems or cameras are used in these scenarios. In the future, the wireless communication service for such devices are expected to be provided by a 5G system. AV production applications require a high degree of confidence, since they are related to the capturing and transmission of data at the beginning of a production chain. This differs drastically when compared to other multimedia services because the communication errors will be propagated to the entire audience that is consuming that content both live and on recorded media. Furthermore, the transmitted data is often post-processed with filters which could actually amplify defects that would be otherwise not noticed by humans. Therefore, these applications call for uncompressed or slightly compressed data, and very low probability of errors. These devices will also be used alongside existing technologies which have a high level of performance and so any new technologies will need to match or improve upon the existing workflows to drive adoption of the technology.\n\n5.4.1\tProfessional production content bitrates\nTable 5.4.1-1 lists common content formats from professional cameras that are output in uncompressed form over the SDI interface, and their corresponding bit rates:\nNOTE 1: The formal standard references are listed in table 5.4.1-1.\nNOTE 2: See also 3GPP TR 22.827 [35].\nNOTE 3: \tThe SDI rates given below are for wired connections within professional production environments. \nTable 5.4.1-1: SDI interface, and their corresponding bit rates\nSMPTE ST 2110 [12] can support transport of compressed or uncompressed streams from cameras with the resolutions above.

As a result, the power consumption caused by unnecessary PDCCH monitoring is unavoidable. The gain for legacy UE power saving features in RRC_CONNECTED, such as Short C-DRX, Long C-DRX, Rel-16 PDCCH-based WUS, or Rel-17 PDCCH monitor adaptation, comes from reducing the PDCCH monitoring time. \nBoth Rel-16 DCP and Rel-17 PDCCH monitor adaptation are both PDCCH based signalling. For a UE equipped with LR, the MR can be in a sleep state while the LR remains active to monitor Low-Power Wake-Up Signal (LP-WUS), and when LP-WUS is received by LR, it will trigger the MR to wake up to monitor PDCCH. As LR would adopt a minimalistic design, the power consumption of LR is expected to be significantly lower than legacy PDCCH based signaling using the main receiver (MR) in some cases. In this way, LP-WUS in RRC_CONNECTED can potentially further reduce the UE energy consumption by being able the monitor the downlink with a LR such that the MR used for PDCCH monitoring can be kept in a sleep state. The LP-WUS/WUR solution should target power saving gain compared to the existing Rel-15/16/17 UE power saving mechanisms, e.g., according to the evaluation results above, {6%~15%} additional UE power saving gain with no capacity loss in both low load and high load cases for DL only XR traffic compared to the existing Rel-15/16/17 power saving solutions. \n\nNOTE 1:\tA PO associated with a PF may start in the PF or after the PF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PDCCH monitoring occasions for a PO can span multiple radio frames.

For both modes, control of uplink and downlink operation can be done by physical layer and MAC layer, within the configuration provided by the RRC layer. In single-DCI mode, the UE is scheduled by the same DCI for both TRPs and in multi-DCI mode, the UE is scheduled by independent DCIs from each TRP.\nThere are two different operation modes for multi-TRP PDCCH: PDCCH repetition as in Clause 5.2.3 and Single Frequency Network (SFN) based PDCCH transmission. In both modes, the UE can receive two PDCCH transmissions, one from each TRP, carrying the same DCI. In PDCCH repetition mode, the UE can receive the two PDCCH transmissions carrying the same DCI from two linked search spaces each associated with a different CORESET. In SFN based PDCCH transmission mode, the UE can receive the two PDCCH transmissions carrying the same DCI from a single search space/CORESET using different TCI states.\n\nIn Rel-16, multi-TRP PDSCH transmission is supported with two different mechanisms: single-DCI and multi-DCI. In Rel-17, multi-TRP PDSCH transmission is further extended to inter-cell operation. A UE can be configured with SSB associated with PCI which are different from serving cell PCI, known as additional PCI. At most 7 different additional PCI can be configured to the UE, and only one is activated for inter-cell multi-TRP operation. The additional PCI can be associated with one or more TCI states, and gNB can schedule PDSCH dynamically from either TRP by indicating TCI in DCI. \nIn Rel-17, beam reporting and BFR are enhanced for mTRP scenario specifically. For beam reporting enhancement, framework of Rel-15 group based beam reporting is extended to facilitate simultaneous transmission of multiple TRPs. To achieve that, one CSI resource setting including two resource sets corresponding to two TRPs can be configured. In a CSI-report, UE can report N (Nmax = {1, 2, 3, 4}) groups of simultaneously received beams, wherein each reported beam in one group corresponds to one TRP. Differential L1-RSRP reporting across all beam groups is supported, and 1-bit is added to indicate CMR set associated with the largest RSRP value in the first group. For BFR enhancements, both single-DCI and multi-DCI framework are supported. For multi-DCI, two explicit or implicit BFD-RS sets are introduced for two TRPs in one CC. BFRQ can be transmitted if any one of BFD-RS sets fails. BFRQ framework is enhanced based on Rel.16 SCell BFR. The maximum number of PUCCH-SR resources is extended to 2. After UE receives gNB\u2019s response, per-TRP beam reset can be performed. When both BFD-RS sets in SpCell fail, CBRA based RACH transmission can be triggered. For single-DCI, only explicit BFD-RS set configuration can be supported. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which mode is used for multi-TRP PDCCH transmission?

Enhancements for Multi-TRP/panel transmission are to further improve DL data rate and spectral efficiency by fully utilizing multi-TRP/panel simultaneously with non-coherent joint transmission (NCJT) in ideal/non-backhaul conditions, or further exploit spatial diversity with time/frequency domain repetition to improve transmission reliability.\nThird, although Rel.15 supports flexible beam management (BM) functionality to accommodate various implementation and usage scenarios, Rel.15 BM signaling framework could require a large amount of signaling for updating beam RS and pathloss reference RS for respective DL and UL signals when the best DL-UL beam pair is changed frequently due to UE mobility, rotation, or beam blockage. Therefore, in Rel.16, five features were introduced for the purpose of BM signaling overhead and latency reduction. Additionally, in Rel.15, L1-RSRP-based beam measurement and reporting are supported. To facilitate interference-aware beam selection, L1-SINR-based beam measurement and reporting were introduced. Finally, in Rel.15, beam failure recovery (BFR) is supported only for spCell. To improve the performance and reliability for SCell, BFR for SCell was introduced.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What was the transmit diversity technique used in Rel-15 for V2X Phase 2?
