The CTF determines whether the request corresponds to an user / network event (event based charging, e.g. MMS) or whether a session shall be started (session based charging, e.g. IP CAN bearer). Generally, this property is built into the network capability, or service, that the NE provides, and described in the middle tier TSs.\nNote that TS 23.078 [207] also specifies online charging capability in the SGSN and MSC based on CAMEL, i.e. using the CAP reference point towards the OCS. This functionality is outside the scope of the present document.\nIn event based charging, a network / user event (e.g. MM submission) corresponds to a single chargeable event. In session based charging, at least two chargeable events are needed, one each to describe the start and the end of the session, respectively. Multiple interim events are possible in order to describe changes of session characteristics (e.g. change of IP CAN bearer QoS or change of IMS session media types), or when certain limits, e.g. time or volume, are exceeded. The CTF transforms each chargeable event into a charging event and forwards these charging events to the OCF in real-time.\n\nThe online,offline charging and converged charging can be categorised into two distinct classes, namely event based charging and session based charging. Event based charging implies that a chargeable event is defined as a single end-user-to-network transaction, e.g. the sending of a multimedia message. This chargeable event is then mapped to an appropriate charging event, resulting in a single CDR or in a single Credit-Control and resource usage authorisation procedure. In contrast, session based charging is characterised by the existence of a user session, such as a circuit call, an IP CAN bearer, an PDU session, or an IMS session. This user session is then matched by a charging session, resulting in the generation of multiple chargeable/charging events and the creation of one or more CDRs in offline charging/converged charging or the performance of a Credit-Control session in online charging/converged charging.

Some requirements derived by service scenarios from these related vertical domains are applicable to the maritime domain. Thus, it is beneficial to use 3GPP enabling technologies developed to satisfy those requirements for the maritime domain in terms of the economy of scale.\nFor example, satellite access is one of the 3GPP radio access networks supported over the 5G system, so it is possible to provide seamless maritime mobile services by integrating multiple access technologies including satellite access depending on the service scenarios. In addition, Vertical LAN that can replace Ethernet-based access are applicable to indoor maritime mobile services inside a vessel.\n\nMC Services specified in 3GPP specifications are applicable to commercial and maritime safety fields. Some similarities exist between the public safety domain and the maritime domain in terms of service scenarios that are essentially the same. For example, in some situations, mobile communication services are supported in spite of disconnected networks, i.e. off-network mode, or under isolated conditions. \nHowever, the maritime domain also has specific situations that do not happen in other vertical domains or in the legacy ICT industrial domain. New 3GPP enabling technologies dedicated to the maritime domain can be used to address such specific situations based on requirements derived from maritime use cases.

Referring to TS 28.552 [13], the evaluation measurements are mainly PRB usage rate-related measurements, which measures usage (in percentage) of physical resource blocks (PRBs). Although these measurements can evaluate the overall resource load of the cell, they cannot effectively evaluate the resource load of the URLLC service under the eMBB and URLLC multiplexing scenarios considering the on-demand transmission requirement.\nFor example, in a statistical time period, the PRB usage rate of the network is low. Because the URLLC service has high requirements for latency, it needs to be transmitted immediately. If the URLLC service has data transmission requirements on the resources scheduled by eMBB, the URLLC service will preempt eMBB service resources. In this case, since the PRB usage rate only reflects the overall resource load of the cell, it cannot reflect the situation that the resources of the URLLC service are insufficient at this time.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which identity is used for indication of pre-emption in the downlink?

Event based charging implies that a chargeable event is defined as a single end-user-to-network transaction, e.g. the sending of a multimedia message. This chargeable event is then mapped to an appropriate charging event, resulting in a single CDR or in a single Credit-Control and resource usage authorisation procedure. In contrast, session based charging is characterised by the existence of a user session, such as a circuit call, an IP CAN bearer, an PDU session, or an IMS session. This user session is then matched by a charging session, resulting in the generation of multiple chargeable/charging events and the creation of one or more CDRs in offline charging/converged charging or the performance of a Credit-Control session in online charging/converged charging. The following paragraphs describe the event versus session based charging in more detail for both online, offline charging. converged charging.\n\nNOTE 2: \tReturning previously reserved amounts of units to the user\u2019s account is up to operator policy in the OCS. The authorization of multiple chargeable events as per the \"event based charging\" description in clause 5.1 is not yet covered in the above scenario.\nSession based online charging always involves reservation within the Credit-Control procedure (SCUR), as there is no way for the OCS to predict the amount of resource usage that occurs during the user session. To begin with, the CTF forward generates a charging chargeable event that corresponds to the resource usage request and maps onto the user session, and forwards it to the OCF. In the OCS, the online charging session is started and a certain amount reserved from the user subscriber account. This amount is determined by the OCS based on the information in the charging event and on local configuration, i.e. operator policy. A resource usage quota, matching the reserved amount, is then returned by the OCS, at which point the user session starts in the NE. Further charging events are sent from the NE to the OCS upon the detection of further chargeable events within the session .e.g. the expiry of in intervals configured on the NE or instructed by the OCS, or when the authorised quota expires, or when session characteristics change (e.g. change of QoS of an IP CAN bearer). The OCS then furnishes a new quota to the NE as required, or rejects the charging event, e.g. due to expiry of credit on the subscriber account. The OCS also furnishes the NE\u2019s behaviour on quota expiry (termination action). When the user session terminates normally in the NE, a final statement on the actually used network resources is returned to the OCS, enabling the OCS to calculate the final value of the actual resource usage session and to properly debit the corresponding final amount from the subscriber account (possibly resulting in a re-crediting of previously reserved amounts).

The adaptation applies to Type3-PDCCH CSS sets or USS sets on the active DL BWP of the serving cell. The adaptation is triggered according to the PDCCH monitoring adaptation indication field, if present, in DCI format 0_1/0_2/1_1/1_2. With the fast adaptation mechanisms, UE can be indicated to perform reduced PDCCH monitoring at the end of or after a duration of data scheduling, thereby achieving UE power saving with minimum impact to data scheduling. \nUE power saving can be achieved through Rel-17 SSSG switching mechanism when Rel-17 SSSG configuration is configured. UE can be indicated to switch to a target SSSG via the indication of a scheduling DCI. If search space switch timer is also configured, UE switches to the SSSG of the lowest group index after timer expiration if no detected DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI/CS-RNTI/MCS-C-RNTI for the configured timer duration. The switch delay is at least Pswitch symbols, and Pswitch depends on the numerology of the serving cell. For Rel-17, UE can be configured with up to 3 SSSGs.\n\nIn 5G radio systems, users in connected mode keep monitoring the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), which carries scheduling grants transmitted by gNB. This continuous monitoring of the PDCCH forces users to stay in active mode even when there is no traffic to be scheduled, thus resulting in unnecessary power consumption. To mitigate this problem, 5G defines UE power saving schemes including Connected mode DRX (CDRX) and PDCCH monitoring adaptation (e.g. PDCCH skipping and Search Space Set Group switching). Both CDRX and PDCCH monitoring adaptation offer the possibility to reduce UE power consumption by alternating between active and sleep periods, by switching the monitoring frequency of PDCCH, and/or by skipping some of the PDCCH monitoring occasions.\nUE power saving schemes can be optimally configured according to the traffic characteristics of XR traffic described above to guarantee the delivering of a packet within the PDB and at the same time maximize the power saving gain.

With a single UL SPS configuration, this induces a maximum delay of P (s)TTIs. To shorten this delay, the specifications allow multiple SPS configurations for the same TTI length to be activated on the same serving cell. By appropriate setting of P, K and the number of SPS configurations for a given TTI length, it is possible to reduce the maximum delay for the UE to be able to transmit UL data to 1 (s)TTI.

PDCP packet duplication is configured for a radio bearer by RRC where two logical channels are configured for the radio bearer. The two logical channels can either belong to the same MAC entity (CA case) or different MAC entities (DC case). When activated, PDCP packet duplication allows sending the same PDCP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) on two independent transmission paths: via the primary RLC entity and a secondary RLC entity, thereby increasing reliability.\n\nThe UE can be configured by eNB with up to 8 sidelink SPS configurations. Each configuration has an identifying index, and provides a different periodicity of sidelink transmission resource. A sidelink SPS configuration is not used by the UE until the eNB sends the UE a DCI which indicates it is now active. The activating DCI also provides all the same fields as a dynamic sidelink scheduling DCI described above, allowing the precise resource allocation for SPS to be determined by eNB at the time it is needed. A transmitting UE can use the thus activated sidelink SPS resources, at the configured periodicity, until they are released (i.e. de-activated) by the eNB transmitting a special DCI.

There is no RAN/CN interaction when the UE change RRC state between RRC-Connected - RRC-Inactive - RRC-Connected. Thus, extending this capability means extending the buffering capacity of RAN . Furthermore, Solution 2 allows a deployment where RAN decides whether to support extended buffering or not. If the RAN chooses to not support extended buffering, then CN buffering (HLcom) is used instead by releasing the UE to CM-IDLE state. In that case, the RAN informs the AMF. Solution 5 reuses existing RAN buffer capability(e.g. around 1.28 or 2.56s). When the RAN determines that it cannot buffer any more downlink data, it informs the AMF to start CN buffering. The CN is not impacted if the RAN receives very few downlink packets during the UE unreachable time.\nThe negative side with RAN buffering for a UE in RRC-Inactive is that legacy buffering is only for typically around 1.28 or 2.56s, which now will be extended to a much longer time.

In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.\n\n7.3\tOverall Evaluation for Key Issue #9\nSolutions that are relevant to KI#9 are summarized and evaluated as the following:\nSol#34: RAN provides UE with multiple CDRX configurations or adaptable CDRX configuration. Based on the UE's operating mode, e.g. high-power or low-power, UE may choose to move from one CDRX configuration to another, or may choose to modify the CDRX configuration parameter, then UE indicates to the RAN node which CDRX configuration is used. In this solution, with the status of power consumption at UE, CDRX parameters may change and thus may have impact at transmission latency, the QoS parameters (e.g. GFBR/MFBR/PDB/PER) are not changed. Trade-off of throughput/reliability and power consumption is not supported, for trade-off of latency and power consumption, as the PDB is not changed, the impact from CDRX could be minor. This solution requires multiple signalling handshakes between the UE and the network in order to (constantly) change the applied CDRX configuration, therefore causing additional UE power consumption and costing radio capacity. No evidence has been shown the solution provides gains over existing CDRX mechanism.

The 5GS Bridge is composed of the ports on a single UPF (i.e. PSA) side, the user plane tunnel between the UE and UPF, and the ports on the DS-TT side. For each 5GS Bridge of a TSN network, the port on NW-TT support the connectivity to the TSN network, the ports on DS-TT side are associated to the PDU Session providing connectivity to the TSN network.\n\nIntegration with IEEE TSN\nTSC is a communication service that supports deterministic and/or isochronous communication with high reliability and availability. It provides packet transport with Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics such as bounded latency and reliability, where end systems and relay/transmit nodes can be strictly synchronized. In Release 16, main focus was on integration with IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). \nThe 5G System also enables support for TSN time synchronization. In order to support time synchronization, the entire E2E 5G system can be considered as an IEEE 802.1AS [104] \"time-aware system\".

A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted.\nA remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID.

Although MUST and the LTE Rel-12 Work Item Network-Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression (NAICS) both rely on receivers to perform interference cancellation, the latter targets the inter-cell interference and is typically used when the user is at the cell edge, while the former aims at the intra-cell interference.\nThe key functionalities of MUST are described as follows. A UE is signalled by RRC if it is to be configured for potential MUST operation. When a UE is higher-layer configured to have MUST, some bits are added into the downlink control information (DCI) as MUST assistance information. The UE monitors some bit field in the DCI to see whether MUST is enabled in a transmit time interval.\n\nIn MUST, there are three cases featured by the mechanisms of PDSCH superposition:\nCase 1: Superposed PDSCHs are transmitted using the same transmission scheme and the same spatial precoding vector\nCase 2: Superposed PDSCHs are transmitted using the same transmit diversity scheme\nCase 3: Superposed PDSCHs are transmitted using the same transmission scheme, but their spatial precoding vectors are different\nFigure 11.4.1.7-1: An example of Case 1 and Case 2 transmit side processing when both near and far UEs have 1 data layer.

An example of transmit side processing for Case 1 and Case 2 is shown in Figure 1. After channel coding, rate matching and scrambling, the coded bits for near and far UEs are jointly mapped to modulation symbols of a composite constellation.

The coordination communication in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. The backhaul-based RIM framework uses a combination of wireless and backhaul communication, while in the wireless framework, the communication is purely wireless.\nIn both frameworks, all gNBs in a victim set simultaneously transmit an identical RIM reference signal carrying the victim set ID over the air.\nIn the wireless framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measures, and send back a RIM reference signal carrying the aggressor set ID. The RIM reference signal sent by the aggressor is able to provide information whether the atmospheric ducting phenomenon exists. The victim gNBs realize the atmospheric ducting phenomenon have ceased upon not receiving any reference signal sent from aggressors.\nIn the RIM backhaul framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measures, and establish backhaul coordination towards the victim gNB set. The backhaul messages are sent from individual aggressor gNBs to individual victim gNB, where the signalling is transparent to the core network. The RIM backhaul messages from aggressor to victim gNBs carry the indication about the detection or disappearance of RIM reference signal. Based on the indication from the backhaul message, the victim gNBs realize whether the atmospheric ducting and the consequent remote interference have ceased.\n\nIn the wireless framework, RIM-RS (RIM reference signal) type 1 and RIM-RS type 2 are specified. Upon reception of the RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type 1) from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measurement, and may send back a RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type 2) carrying the aggressor set ID if configured, and may undertake interference mitigation actions. The RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type 2) sent by the aggressor is able to facilitate estimation whether the atmospheric ducting phenomenon between victim and aggressor sets exists.\nIn the RIM backhaul framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type 1) from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measurement, establish backhaul coordination towards the victim gNB set.

By contracting the roaming hub, the operator obtains access to a large roaming footprint, without individually contracting the operators that are mediated through the hub. Apart from mediating the signalling, roaming hubs typically also mediate the billing.\n-\tOperator Group Roaming Hubs offer similar services as public roaming hubs, and are special in that they are used by group network operator companies that reside in the same security domain to consolidate and secure operator group roaming. \n\nIt is a requirement that users shall be able to obtain service and use chargeable services with networks with whom neither they nor their home environment have any direct commercial agreement.

This is an improvement over Rel-16 wherein the access performance measurements are always conducted over the default QoS flow and, therefore, provide a rough estimate of the RTT / PLR.\n\tWhether the access performance measurements for a data flow are conducted over the default QoS flow (as in Rel-16), or over the same QoS flow used to carry the data flow, is determined by the network during the MA PDU Session establishment. More details can be found in [1], clause 5.32.5.\n-\tLoad-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages: This introduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses.

The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput.

PPPR allows management of reliability, for example see Clause 5.4.7. The PPPP of a packet is indicated dynamically in the SCI which schedules the PSSCH for the packet. A physical measurement of CBR is also defined in each subframe TS\u00a036.214 [12, clause 5.1.30], which measures the portion of the resource in a resource pool which has a high received signal energy (S-RSSI) in the most recent 100 subframes. CBR is a measurement of the congestion present recently in the resource pool. Another measurement, CR defined in TS\u00a036.214 [12, clause 5.1.31], counts the total number of subchannels a UE has and will transmit in during a window of up to 1000 ms including the current subframe. CR is thus a measurement of how much resource a UE has recently, and will soon, claim.\nA UE can be (pre-)configured with a set of CBR ranges to each of which is linked a CR-limit. When a UE finds its CR exceeds the CR-limit for the CBR range it currently measures, it  must reduce its CR to not exceed the limit.

This action can be accomplished for an ongoing MCData communication over the media plane, or over HTTP. The authorized MCData user may have been monitoring the ongoing MCData communication. Prior to the communication release, the target MCData user is given a notification that ongoing MCData communication release is pending. The target MCData user may request an extension from the authorized MCData user before release. If the extension is granted the MCData communication will continue.

For simplicity the \u2206thermal value is recalculated to allowed SNR difference (allowed noise increase). 400 MHz CBW and -13 dB backoff from P1dB were selected for the analysis. Note that at 3 dB allowed noise increase, Noc level becomes the same as UE thermal noise level.  \nTable 7.2.3-3: Allowed noise increase vs max achievable DL SNR\nMinimum FR2-1 DL radiated performance requirements are specified for up to Rank 2.

For instance, 16 and 20 dB SNRs can be assumed. Such SNR targets require adjustments of TE parameters. Table 7.2.3-4 summarizes required wanted signal + headroom budget to reach 16 and 20 dB DL SNR.

Although range length for the DFF setup is not a requirement for permitted methods, a reference value of 0.725m is used in the TR38.810 calculations.  Furthermore, the maximum achievable SNR values are calculated assuming the highest band n259 frequency (f=43.5 GHz).  The highest frequency to be considered for the SNR calculation is the highest frequency of band n262:  48.2 GHz.

The re-attempts continue to fail until UE enters the coverage and respond to the paging attempts. This repetitive paging attempts result in the wastage of network resources. As an example, the use case includes a user or a group of users getting into an area, with no cellular coverage on a regular basis for a considerably long duration, for e.g. the user gets into a shielded room for some testing purpose every day for a defined period. The Network initiated paging for such users will fail until they are back in the area with cellular coverage. This would result in in-efficient network resource usage.\nIt is desirable to use MDAS (Management data analytic service) to optimize the current paging procedures in 5G networks. MDAS producer provides an analytics output containing the user(s) paging analytics indicating the time window at which a group of users are OOC on a regular basis at the particular location. MDAS producer also provides the geographical map within which the UEs would experience paging issues and hence will not be able to respond on a network-initiated paging. Based on the provided MDA output, MDAS consumer (e.g.\u00a0AMF, gNB) decides on whether, when and where to initiate or not to initiate the paging procedures, thereby ensuring the efficient paging procedures and optimal network resource utilization, as paging can be initiated only when there are more chances for it to be successful.\n\n8.4.1\tCoverage related analytics\n8.4.1.1\tCoverage problem analysis\n8.4.1.1.1\tMDA type\nThe MDA type for coverage problem analysis is: CoverageAnalytics.CoverageProblemAnalysis.\n8.4.1.1.2\tEnabling data\nThe enabling data for CoverageAnalytics.CoverageProblemAnalysis MDA type are provided in table 8.4.1.1.2-1.\nFor general information about enabling data, see clause 8.2.1.\nTable 8.4.1.1.2-1: Enabling data for coverage problem analysis\n8.4.1.1.3\tAnalytics output\nThe specific information elements of the analytics output for coverage problem analysis, in addition to the common information elements of the analytics outputs (see clause 8.3), are provided in table 8.4.1.1.3-1.\nTable 8.4.1.1.3-1: Analytics output for coverage problem analysis\n8.4.1.2\tPaging Optimization\n8.4.1.2.1\tMDA type\nThe MDA type for Capability-Paging Optimization: CoverageAnalytics.PagingOptimization.\n8.4.1.2.2\tEnabling data\nThe enabling data for paging optimization are provided in table 8.4.1.2.2-1.\nTable 8.4.1.2.2-1: Enabling data for Paging Optimization Analysis\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the MDA capability for paging optimization analysis used for?

Beam scanning performance in azimuth plane when antenna element separation is 0.5\u03bb at higher limit (a) 26 GHz, and (b) 38 GHz.\nIn addition to the physical limitations and grating lobe performance discussed, it should also be noted that the array is electrically shorter at lower frequencies than higher frequencies and this also affects the antenna directivity and gain. For example, there is approximately 3dB gain difference between low band (26GHz) and high band (38GHz) that can be seen in Figure 5.3.2-2. This factor may also be a consideration when planning an antenna design.\nTaking another example, Figure 5.3.2-3 shows the directivity of an 8x8 uniform rectangular phased array with respect to different element separations. The antenna elements described in [31] are used in the simulation. It is seen that lower element separation will result in low array directivity. This means if the separations seen by lower frequency band is low, it likely consumes more energy to deliver acceptable array performance and cause power imbalance with higher bands, while the EIS receiver sensitive is low. The directivity difference between operating frequency bands may also be a consideration when planning an antenna design.\n\nIt was also pointed out that the radiation pattern of V-pol and H-pol of an antenna module is not exactly same, and when metal blockage exist, the difference may be amplified due to the reflection as shown in the Figure below. In practical UE design, to avoid severe blockage, the metal frame near the antenna module can be removed and replaced by other materials, but the V/H element may still suffer from different loss, which still lead to difference between V-pol and H-pol.\nFigure 6.3.6-1The radiation pattern of a pair of V/H element in 1x4 antenna module\nIf the gain difference exists between V-pol and H-pol, for each receiver branch, the projection from  and  should be calculated, and the following procedure to calculate received signal can be used:\nStep-1: Extract the antenna gain in \u03b8 direction and \u03c6 direction in module reference system when only V-elements are activated, i.e., GV,M (M, M) and GV,M (M, M)\nStep-2: Extract the antenna gain in \u03b8 direction and \u03c6 direction in module reference system when only H-elements are activated, i.e., GH,M (M, M) and GH,M (M, M)\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the relation between the antenna element pattern in the GCS and the LCS?

The configurable time can be as large as 2 seconds, which facilitates UE implementations with a wake-up receiver (WUR).\n-\tEarly data transmission (EDT): For scenarios where the UE only needs to transmit a small amount of data, the EDT feature enables the UE to transmit up to (slightly more than) 100 bytes of data already in message 3 during the random-access procedure, and to receive data already in message 4. In this release, only mobile-originated (MO) EDT access is supported. If needed, eNB can order fallback to legacy random-access procedure during the EDT procedure.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which feature in Rel-16 enables reduced UE power consumption in idle mode by transmitting a wakeup signal to a group of UEs?

GNSS carrier phase positioning has been used very successfully for centimetre-level positioning but is limited to outdoor applications. NR carrier phase positioning has the potential for significant performance improvements for indoor and outdoor deployments in comparison with the existing NR positioning methods, as well as shorter latency and lower UE power consumption in comparison with RTK-GNSS outdoors.\nPositioning integrity is a measure of the trust in the accuracy of the position-related data and the ability to provide timely warnings based on assistance data provided by the network. The focus in Release 17 work was on GNSS integrity, and for Release 18 it is natural to extend this to address other positioning techniques as well as there are relevant integrity aspects of mission critical use cases that rely on positioning estimates and the corresponding uncertainty estimate.

To meet the battery life requirements above, eDRX cycle with large value is expected to be used, resulting in high latency, which is not suitable for such services with requirements of both long battery life and low latency. For example, in fire detection and extinguishment use case, fire shutters shall be closed and fire sprinklers shall be turned on by the actuators within 1 to 2 seconds from the time the fire is detected by sensors, long eDRX cycle cannot meet the delay requirements. eDRX is apparently not suitable for latency-critical use cases. Thus, the intention is to study ultra-low power mechanism that can support low latency in Rel-18, e.g. lower than eDRX latency.\nCurrently, UEs need to periodically wake up once per DRX cycle, which dominates the power consumption in periods with no signalling or data traffic. If UEs are able to wake up only when they are triggered, e.g., paging, power consumption could be dramatically reduced. This can be achieved by using a wake-up signal to trigger the main radio and a separate receiver which has the ability to monitor wake-up signal with ultra-low power consumption.

The integration of the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) to the 5G Core (5GC) introduces Service Based Interfaces (SBA) for the related GBA Network Functions as well as specific GBA services for the User Data Management (UDM) network function in 5GC. In this way GBA can be used in 5GC deployments.\nThe 3GPP authentication infrastructure employed in GBA includes Home Network (HN) functions User Equipment (UE) functions and the 3GPP AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) protocol. This infrastructure is a very valuable asset of 3GPP operators and could be leveraged to enable application functions in the network and on the User Equipment (UE) side to establish shared cryptographic material based on 3GPP credentials.

The arrangement is illustrated in Figure 7.2-2 and is designed to enhance the system level performance under high density while meeting the latency requirements of V2V. Scheduling assignments (SA or PSCCH) are transmitted in sub-channels using specific RBs across time.

In general, any device that has intermittent small data packets in INACTIVE state will benefit from enabling small data transmission in INACTIVE. \nThe key enablers for small data transmission in NR, namely the INACTIVE state, 2-step, 4-step RACH and configured grant type-1 have already been specified as part of Rel-15 and Rel-16.

SDT is enabled on a radio bearer basis and can be initiated either by the UE in case of MO-SDT (Mobile Originated SDT) or by the network in case of MT-SDT (Mobile Terminated SDT). MO-SDT is initiated by the UE only if less than or equal to a configured amount of UL data awaits transmission across all radio bearers for which SDT is enabled, the DL RSRP is above a configured threshold, and a valid SDT resource is available as specified in clause 5.27.1 of TS 38.321 [6]. MT-SDT is initiated by the network with an indication to the UE in a paging message when DL data awaits transmission for radio bearers configured for SDT; based on the indication, the UE initiates the MT-SDT only if the DL RSRP is above a configured threshold as specified in clause 5.27.1 of TS 38.321 [6]. When MT-SDT is initiated by the UE, a resume cause indicating MT-SDT is included in the RRCResumeRequest/RRCResumeRequest1. Maximum duration the SDT procedure can last is dictated by a SDT failure detection timer that is configured by the network (see clause 6.2.2 of TS 38.331 [12]).

To enable this reflective mapping, the NG-RAN marks downlink packets over Uu with QFI.\n\nThe QoS architecture in NG-RAN, both for NR connected to 5GC and for E-UTRA connected to 5GC, is depicted in the Figure 12-1 and described in the following:\n-\tFor each UE, 5GC establishes one or more PDU Sessions;\n-\tExcept for NB-IoT, IAB-MT in SA mode, and NCR-MT, for each UE, the NG-RAN establishes at least one Data Radio Bearers (DRB) together with the PDU Session and additional DRB(s) for QoS flow(s) of that PDU session can be subsequently configured (it is up to NG-RAN when to do so);\n-\tIf NB-IoT UE supports NG-U data transfer, the NG-RAN may establish Data Radio Bearers (DRB) together with the PDU Session and one PDU session maps to only one DRB;\n-\tThe NG-RAN maps packets belonging to different PDU sessions to different DRBs;\n-\tNAS level packet filters in the UE and in the 5GC associate UL and DL packets with QoS Flows;\n-\tAS-level mapping rules in the UE and in the NG-RAN associate UL and DL QoS Flows with DRBs.\nFigure 12-1: QoS architecture\nNG-RAN and 5GC ensure quality of service (e.g. reliability and target delay) by mapping packets to appropriate QoS Flows and DRBs. Hence there is a 2-step mapping of IP-flows to QoS flows (NAS) and from QoS flows to DRBs (Access Stratum).\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('How are QoS flows mapped to DRBs in the uplink?

A study item [1] was drafted accordingly, along with a corresponding RAN study item [13]. The SA2 study item conclusions are documented in TR 23.743 [2]. The conclusions of the RAN study item are documented in TR 37.873 [14]. Subsequent to the study items, work items were drafted in SA ([5]) and RAN ([10]) to implement optimisations to the UE radio capability signalling.\nThe work is divided into two subfeatures, UE radio capability ID and UE capability segmentation.\nUE Radio Capability ID\n\nThe network redirects the UE to 5GCN by rejecting the attach request, or tracking area update request, or service request with the EMM cause #31 \"Redirection to 5GCN required\" as specified in clause\u00a05.5.1.2.5,\u00a05.5.1.3.5,\u00a05.5.3.2.5,\u00a05.5.3.3.5 and\u00a05.6.1.5.

The energy consumption of a virtual compute resource instance X is estimated as a proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtual compute resource instance X runs.

The Name-based Routing mechanism, described in this deployment example, is realized through a Path Computation Element which is the core part of the SCP. The 5GC Services are running as microservices on cloud/deployment units (clusters). A Service Router is the communication node (access node/gateway) between the SCP and the 5GC Services and resides as a single unit within a Service Deployment Cluster. The Service Router acts as communication proxy and it is responsible for mapping IP based messages onto ICN publication and subscriptions. The Service Router serves multiple 5GC Service Endpoints within that cluster. For direct communication the Service Router is not used.\n5GC Functionalities communicate with the Service Router using standardized 3GPP SBIs.\nThe Functionalities within the Service Deployment Cluster are containerized Service Functions.\nDepicted in Figure G.4-1, the Service Router act as SCP termination point and offer the SBI to the respective 5GC Service Functionalities. In this example, Service Routers and 5GC functionality, although co-located, are separate components within the Service Deployment Cluster. Multiple Functionalities can exist within the Service Deployment Cluster, all served by the respective Service Router when needed to communicate to other Service Functionalities within different clusters.\n\nFigure G.2.2-1: Message routing across service mesh boundaries\nG.3\tAn SCP based on independent deployment units\nThis clause shows an overview of SCP deployment based on the 5GC functionality and SCP being deployed in independent deployment units.\nFigure G.3-1: Independent deployment units for SCP and 5GC functionality\nThe SCP deployment unit can internally make use of microservices, however these microservices are up to vendors implementation and can be for example SCP agents and SCP controller as used in this example. The SCP agents implement the http intermediaries between service consumers and service producers. The SCP agents are controlled by the SCP controller. Communication between SCP controller and SCP agents is via SCP internal interface (4) and up to vendors implementation.\nIn this model it is a deployment choice to co-locate SCP and other 5GC functions or not. The SCP interfaces (1), (2) and (3) are service based interfaces. SCP itself is not a service producer itself, however acting as http proxy it registers services on behave of the producers in NRF.

Various PDU session types are supported including IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet and Unstructured.\nThe 5G's main characteristic is the introduction of a new radio interface, the New Radio (NR), which offers the flexibility needed to support these very different types of services.\nAnother key characteristic of 5G is that the 5G Access Network can connect not only to a new 5G Core Network but also to the 4G (LTE) Core Network. This is known as the NSA architecture, while the 5G AN connected to a 5G CN is called the SA architecture.\nOn the Core Network side, the 5G System offers also a wide array of new characteristics, such as a deeper use of Network Slicing, Mobile Edge Computing or Network Capability Exposure. All these concepts are presented below.\n\n5.3.3\tOverview of the Core Network\nIn the SA deployment option, the 5G System (5GS) is composed of the User Equipment, the Access Network (including the \"New Radio\" or NR) and the Core Network (5GC or 5GCN).\nThe service requirements, as presented in the previous clause, were used as a basis to define the architecture. The architecture specification (a.k.a. Stage 2) started with a preliminary study in TR\u00a023.799 [4], also called \"NextGen TR\", before being fully specified in TS 23.501 [1], TS 23.502 [2] and TS 23.503 [3]. \nThe 5GC architecture relies on a so-called \"Service-Based Architecture\" (SBA) framework, where the architecture elements are defined in terms of \"Network Functions\" (NFs) rather than by \"traditional\" Network Entities. Via interfaces of a common framework, any given NF offers its services to all the other authorized NFs and/or to any \"consumers\" that are permitted to make use of these provided services. Such an SBA approach offers modularity and reusability.\nThe basic (SA, non-roaming) 5G System architecture is shown below (figure introduced by the editor):\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the main characteristic of the 5GC architecture?

A new DCI format 2_6 is introduced with CRC scrambled by PS-RNTI (DCP) which contains the wakeup indication as well as SCell dormancy indication if configured.A PS-offset is semi-statically configured before DRX ON defining the start of the interval for the DCP monitor occasion as shown in Figure 1.More than one monitoring occasions could be configured for DCP on PCell for CA and SpCell for DC based on the search space and CORESET configurations.Minimum time gap is specified as the UE processing time as shown in Figure 1. UE is not required to monitor DCP at the interval of minimum time gap and within Active Time. \n\nThe power consumption depends on the configured length of wake-up periods, e.g., paging cycle. To meet the battery life requirements above, eDRX cycle with large value is expected to be used, resulting in high latency, which is not suitable for such services with requirements of both long battery life and low latency. For example, in fire detection and extinguishment use case, fire shutters shall be closed and fire sprinklers shall be turned on by the actuators within 1 to 2 seconds from the time the fire is detected by sensors, long eDRX cycle cannot meet the delay requirements. eDRX is apparently not suitable for latency-critical use cases. Thus, the intention is to study ultra-low power mechanism that can support low latency in Rel-18, e.g. lower than eDRX latency.\nCurrently, UEs need to periodically wake up once per DRX cycle, which dominates the power consumption in periods with no signalling or data traffic. If UEs are able to wake up only when they are triggered, e.g., paging, power consumption could be dramatically reduced. This can be achieved by using a wake-up signal to trigger the main radio and a separate receiver which has the ability to monitor wake-up signal with ultra-low power consumption. Main radio works for data transmission and reception, which can be turned off or set to deep sleep unless it is turned on.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of the PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel for wake-up purpose?

The data collected could include measurements, such as Ec/No and RSCP for case of UMTS and RSRP and RSRQ for case of E-UTRAN, and statistical business level KPIs such as sampled call drop rate and application layer throughput. By periodically sampling these network performance data, managers of the operator can monitor overall performance of the network and compare performance differences between areas or periods.

A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted.\nA remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID.

Although range length for the DFF setup is not a requirement for permitted methods, a reference value of 0.725m is used in the TR38.810 calculations.  Furthermore, the maximum achievable SNR values are calculated assuming the highest band n259 frequency (f=43.5 GHz).  The highest frequency to be considered for the SNR calculation is the highest frequency of band n262:  48.2 GHz.  Using the reference range length of 0.725m we determine free space path loss at f=48.2 GHz, as shown in Figure 7.1-1 below.\nFigure 7.1-1: Free space path loss vs. frequency for d=0.725m\nBased on this analysis, the relative increase in free space path loss from 43.5 GHz to 48.2 GHz is 0.9 dB.\nAnother parameter in the SNR calculation which scales with frequency is cable loss per meter.  Using the datasheets from five different commercially available RF cables, which are rated up to 50 GHz, the average cable loss per meter is calculated (averaging performed in linear gain units), as shown in Figure 7.1-2 below.\n\nFigure 7.1-2: Cable loss per meter vs. frequency\nBased on this analysis, the relative increase in cable loss per meter from 43.5 GHz to 48.2 GHz is 0.33 dB.\nThe SNR calculation related to cable loss also includes connector losses and additional margin, and it is feasible to reuse these parameters for the calculations related to band n262.\nThe SNR calculation also includes two parameters which are taken from UE RF requirements:  REFSENS and multi-band relaxation.

With this feature, the UE can use a combination of DMRS and CRS for MPDCCH demodulation to improve the MPDCCH performance. The feature takes the configured DMRS-to-CRS power ratio into account. The feature can be used for transmissions in idle mode and/or connected mode. In idle mode, the DMRS-to-CRS mapping is based on precoder cycling, whereas in connected mode, it can be configured to be precoder cycling based, CSI-based, or (in case of TDD) reciprocity-based.\nBeside the features listed above, the features described in sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.6 can also improve UE power consumption and/or transmission efficiency in DL and/or UL.\nPreconfigured uplink resources (PUR)\nIn Rel-15, signalling overhead and power consumption reductions were introduced by the (mobile-originated) early data transmission (EDT) feature, where data can be transmitted already in Msg3 during the random-access procedure.\nIn Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR).

The UE can be potentially configured with a cyclic shift of DMRS, which allows sharing of the preconfigured resources under which up to two users can transmit NPUSCH simultaneously when the NPUSCH transmission is larger than or equal to 64ms for 12-tone allocation. By skipping the random access procedures, the uplink transmission efficiency can be improved and UE power consumption is reduced. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change.

Legacy 3GPP-based technologies and solutions can be beneficial to the digitalisation and mobilisation of the maritime domain though some of the legacy 3GPP enabling technologies and solutions may not be able to fully support the performances required by the maritime domain.

Although range length for the DFF setup is not a requirement for permitted methods, a reference value of 0.725m is used in the TR38.810 calculations.  Furthermore, the maximum achievable SNR values are calculated assuming the highest band n259 frequency (f=43.5 GHz).  The highest frequency to be considered for the SNR calculation is the highest frequency of band n262:  48.2 GHz.

The re-attempts continue to fail until UE enters the coverage and respond to the paging attempts. This repetitive paging attempts result in the wastage of network resources. As an example, the use case includes a user or a group of users getting into an area, with no cellular coverage on a regular basis for a considerably long duration, for e.g. the user gets into a shielded room for some testing purpose every day for a defined period. The Network initiated paging for such users will fail until they are back in the area with cellular coverage. This would result in in-efficient network resource usage.\nIt is desirable to use MDAS (Management data analytic service) to optimize the current paging procedures in 5G networks. MDAS producer provides an analytics output containing the user(s) paging analytics indicating the time window at which a group of users are OOC on a regular basis at the particular location. MDAS producer also provides the geographical map within which the UEs would experience paging issues and hence will not be able to respond on a network-initiated paging. Based on the provided MDA output, MDAS consumer (e.g.\u00a0AMF, gNB) decides on whether, when and where to initiate or not to initiate the paging procedures, thereby ensuring the efficient paging procedures and optimal network resource utilization, as paging can be initiated only when there are more chances for it to be successful.\n\n9.7.2\tSupport for Multi-SIM Devices for LTE/NR\nSummary based on the input provided by vivo in RP -220604.\nThis work item specifies solutions to address the paging occasion collision issue for single-Rx/single-Tx Multi-USIM (MUSIM) UE, and to notify network A of its switch from network A for MUSIM purpose, and to support indicating to the MUSIM UE whether an incoming paging is for voice service. \nThe following schemes were introduced as part of the Work Item:\n-\tPaging collision objective: To solve paging occasion collision problem, the MUSIM UE can trigger a new 5G-GUTI reallocation in 5GS or an IMSI offset assignment in EPS to modify the timing of the paging occasions. In 5GS, the UE obtains a new 5G-GUTI by performing a MRU without any specific indication. In EPS, the UE can provide a requested IMSI offset value in Attach Request or TAU Request, which triggers the MME to provide an accepted IMSI Offset value in the Attach Accept or TAU Accept message. The MME and UE use the alternative IMSI (calculated based on the IMSI and the accepted IMSI offset) for the determination of paging occasion. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What problem can occur with the current paging procedures in 5G networks?

In addition, an explicit list of end-to-end network scenarios covered under the scope of MPS was added.\n\nOne potential guideline to prevent unwanted starving of lower-priority messages is to have higher-priority messages represent a relatively small portion of messages handled by the 5GC under normal scenarios. The Multimedia Priority Service (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[5] clause\u00a05.16.5) and the Mission Critical Service (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[5] clause\u00a05.16.6) typically generate little traffic compared to the total traffic of a 5GC.\nThe Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) and the Mission Critical Service (MCX) require the blocking of lower-priority services.\n-\tA network entity (e.g., the AMF) that has received an RRC Establishment Cause associated with priority service (e.g., mps-PriorityAccess, mcs-PriorityAccess, or highPriorityAccess) or has determined that the UE has a priority subscription (e.g., MPS, MCX) in the UDM/UDR, shall select an SMP value appropriate for the priority service (e.g., MPS, MCX) for use in requests and responses.\nNOTE\u00a01:\tOther situations (e.g., certain ARP, 5QI Priority Level or 5QI values) and/or other network elements (e.g., UDM, PCF, etc.) can also set the SMP to an appropriate level for a priority service.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of Multimedia Priority Service Modifications?

In addition, a new uplink coverage class CC5 is added to improve the MCL performance in uplink by 4 dB compared to Release 13, which is specified both for 4 and 2 consecutive time slot resources.\nThe two aspects (EC operation with reduced number of PDCH resources) and (New uplink coverage class for improved uplink MCL performance) are developed below.\nA. EC operation with reduced number of PDCH resources\nAn additional coverage class mapping of blind physical layer transmissions is introduced for higher coverage classes CC2 to CC4 where only 2 consecutive timeslot resources per TDMA frame are available for extended coverage operation. The new coverage class mapping will have increased (i.e. doubled) BTTI compared to existing coverage classes as blind physical layer transmissions need to be extended over twice the number of TDMA frames compared to 4 consecutive timeslot resources.\n\nThe reference sensitivity performance of the new coverage class mapping is comparable to that for the corresponding higher coverage class with 4 PDCH mapping. This feature allows the network to deploy EC-GSM-IoT services by allocating a minimum number of timeslots (i.e. 2) for EC traffic channel operation.

The CC5 random access channel uses one of 2 specified extended access burst formats spanning across 2 timeslots: one format is based on an extended synchronization sequence whereas the other format is based on two successive bursts using partially blind physical layer transmission of bursts within a TDMA frame.

The feature defines QoE measurement configuration and measurement reporting containers, and the feature uses the MDT framework [1]. QoE measurement configuration received from OAM or CN is encapsulated in a container, which is inserted in a Measurement Control message and forwarded to the UE transparently. QoE measurements received from UE higher layer are inserted in a container in a Measurement Report message and sent over SRB4.\nThe QoE measurement configuration is supported in CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH states, whereas the QoE measurement reporting is supported in CELL_DCH state only.\nBoth signalling based and management based initiation cases are allowed. For the signalling based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated towards a specific UE from CN nodes using the MDT mechanism as described in clause 5.1.3 [1]; for the management based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated from OAM targeting an area (without targeting a specific UE).\n\nFor management-based QoE measurement activation, the OAM sends one or more QoE measurement configurations directly to the gNB. The QoE measurement configuration for management-based activation also includes an application layer measurement configuration list and the corresponding information for QoE measurement collection. The gNB selects UE(s) that meet the required QoE measurement capability, area scope and slice scope.\nApplication layer measurement configuration received by the gNB from OAM or 5GC is encapsulated in a transparent container, which is forwarded to a UE as Application layer configuration in the RRCReconfiguration message (there can be multiple configurations in the same message).

The UE can send multiple application layer measurement reports to the gNB in one MeasurementReportAppLayer message. In order to allow the transmission of application layer measurement reports which exceed the maximum PDCP SDU size, segmentation of the MeasurementReportAppLayer message may be enabled by the gNB. A measurement configuration application layer ID conveyed in the RRC signalling is used to identify the application layer measurement configuration and report between the gNB and the UE. The measurement configuration application layer ID is mapped to the QoE reference in the gNB, and the gNB forwards the application layer measurement report to MCE together with the QoE reference. The gNB can release one or multiple application layer measurement configurations from the UE in one RRCReconfiguration message at any time.

PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for MCCH transmission are determined according to the common search space indicated by searchspaceMCCH. If searchspaceMCCH is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message reception in the MCCH transmission window are the same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213[13]. If searchspaceMCCH is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message are determined based on search space indicated by searchspaceMCCH. PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the MCCH transmission window. The [x\u00d7N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion for MCCH message in MCCH transmission window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, \u2026N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in MCCH transmission window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the MCCH transmission window, PDCCH for an MCCH message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception MCCH messages is up to UE implementation.\n\nThe following principles govern the MCCH structure:\n-\tMCCH provides the list of all broadcast services with ongoing sessions transmitted on MTCH(s) and the associated information for broadcast session includes MBS session ID, associated G-RNTI scheduling information and information about neighbouring cells providing certain service on MTCH(s). MCCH content is transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows, referred to as MCCH transmission window defined by MCCH repetition period, MCCH window duration and radio frame/slot offset;\n-\tMCCH uses a modification period and MCCH contents are only allowed to be modified at each modification period boundary; a notification mechanism is used to announce the change of MCCH contents due to broadcast session start, modification or stop and due to neighbouring cell information modification;\nNOTE:\tIt is up to UE implementation to use the start and stop times in the USD to determine when to start monitoring the MCCH for the session the UE is interested in.\n-\tWhen the UE receives an MCCH change notification, it acquires the updated MCCH in the same MCCH modification period where the change notification is sent.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('How are MCCH transmissions and associated radio resources indicated to the UE?

However, there is the need to enhance the granularity and the accuracy of the QoS Sustainability analytics as well as to extend the QoS parameters that the QoS Sustainability notification can be provided. The latter will help to increase the usefulness of the specific analytics ID as well as to support the requirements of various use cases (e.g. V2X related).\nMore accurate QoS Sustainability outputs needs QoS and input parameters to be associated with more accurate location and speed information, when input information is monitored at RAN. Also, the list of input features of the QoS Sustainability analytics ID should be extended by adding information on radio resource utilization and performance measurements for transfer over the UP to improve the correctness and accuracy of QoS sustainability output. Finally, NWDAF should also be able to collect - optionally - additional information on the context that is related to those performance measurements when such information is available, such as PEI, Subscriber category, Operating system information, information on the serving UPF node. Different UPF nodes serving the UE may be responsible for very different QoS, depending on the location of the UPF node such as in edge deployments. PEI may also be used to retrieve from services such as the GSMA database, additional information such as device model, device manufacturer, IMEI or IMEISV or TAC range, supported frequency bands, equipment type. Such additional information may be used by NWDAF to add more information to the collected measurements and filter those measurements that are applicable to the UE and subscription context for which analytics are requested by the service consumer.\n\nThe feature is structured with a baseline core functionality and some optional enhancements as illustrated in Figure 1.

MNOs choosing not to enable the feature can remove the attribute in the SDP negotiation. The attribute is also used by the PCRF/PCF to determine whether it can expect the MTSI clients to adapt to the most robust configurations that have been negotiated without relying in application layer redundancy. The PCRF/PCF uses this information to determine the appropriate PLR thresholds, i.e., choosing the PLR of the most robust mode when \u2018PLR_adapt\u2019 is negotiated, and communicate the PLR thresholds to the eNB/gNB.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which feature enhances the granularity of RSTD reporting?

This continuous monitoring of the PDCCH forces users to stay in active mode even when there is no traffic to be scheduled, thus resulting in unnecessary power consumption. To mitigate this problem, 5G defines UE power saving schemes including Connected mode DRX (CDRX) and PDCCH monitoring adaptation (e.g. PDCCH skipping and Search Space Set Group switching). Both CDRX and PDCCH monitoring adaptation offer the possibility to reduce UE power consumption by alternating between active and sleep periods, by switching the monitoring frequency of PDCCH, and/or by skipping some of the PDCCH monitoring occasions.\nUE power saving schemes can be optimally configured according to the traffic characteristics of XR traffic described above to guarantee the delivering of a packet within the PDB and at the same time maximize the power saving gain. Therefore, UE power saving scheme would benefit from application awareness in the form of additional information either carried over the user plane or new assistance information delivered using the control plane.\n\nPower Saving Techniques in CONNECTED state\nThe power saving techniques are dynamically triggered by L1 signaling indicated from PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel or semi-statically configured by RRC signaling.The PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel reuses the existing PDCCH search space and CORESET configurations with dynamic TCI states with DCI field indicating the adaptation to achieve UE power saving, such as UE wakeup in the DRX operation, cross-slot scheduling, and maximum MIMO layer adaptation through BWP switching. \n-\tDRX adaptation\nThe DRX adaptation power saving technique is to configure the PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel at the active BWP before the beginning of DRX ON for UE monitoring with the indication of UE wakeup or not depending on whether there is data for UE to receive. A new DCI format 2_6 is introduced with CRC scrambled by PS-RNTI (DCP) which contains the wakeup indication as well as SCell dormancy indication if configured.A PS-offset is semi-statically configured before DRX ON defining the start of the interval for the DCP monitor occasion as shown in Figure 1.More than one monitoring occasions could be configured for DCP on PCell for CA and SpCell for DC based on the search space and CORESET configurations.Minimum time gap is specified as the UE processing time as shown in Figure 1.

This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging.

The WUS feature enables UEs to determine that in the paging occasions immediately following their WUS occasion they will not be paged if their WUS is not transmitted, or that they might be paged if their WUS is transmitted (see TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[52]).\nTo avoid waking up UEs due to an AMF paging other UEs across multiple cells (e.g. due to frequent UE mobility and/or for low paging latency services such as VoLTE), the use of WUS by the ng-eNB and the UE is restricted to the last used cell, i.e. the cell in which the UE's RRC connection was last released.

The length of DwPTS and UpPTS is configurable subject to the total length of DwPTS, GP and UpPTS being equal to 1ms. Both 5ms and 10ms switch-point periodicity are supported. Subframe  all configurations and subframe  configuration with 5ms switch-point periodicity consist of DwPTS, GP and UpPTS. Subframe  configuration with 10ms switch-point periodicity consists of DwPTS only. All other subframes consist of two equally sized slots.\n\nAs for the time domain, it is divided in 10ms radio frames, each on consisting in 10 subframes of 1ms each, as shown in the picture below. \nFigure 5.5.4.1-1: Frame structure in NR\nIn turn, each subframe consists of 1/2/4/8/16 slots -shown in different colors- depending on the selected SCS/numerology.  The figure shows the cases of SCS values of 15; 30; 60 and 120 KHz, while the table below provides the full list of possible numerologies in NR. As shown in the figure for the 15 kHz case, each slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols (independently of the SCS) preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP). \nTable 5.5.4.1-2: Multiple numerologies in NR\nNote: \tAdditional specific numerologies are defined for PRACH, as described in Section 5.5.4.3.\nNote that, for the 60 kHz SCS, an extended CP is possible. The extended CP is approximately four times longer than the normal CP and is used for cells having large delay spread. In this case, one slot consists of only 12 OFDM symbols.\nThe OFDM symbol duration and CP length are inversely proportional of the SCS. E.g. for 15 kHz SCS, the OFDM symbol duration is approximately 66.6 \u00b5s and the CP length is approximately 4.7 \u00b5s. When the SCS is doubled, i.e. 30 kHz, the OFDM and CP lengths are approximately devided by two compared to the 15kHz SCS. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the duration of radio frame structure type 1?

Although range length for the DFF setup is not a requirement for permitted methods, a reference value of 0.725m is used in the TR38.810 calculations.  Furthermore, the maximum achievable SNR values are calculated assuming the highest band n259 frequency (f=43.5 GHz).  The highest frequency to be considered for the SNR calculation is the highest frequency of band n262:  48.2 GHz.  Using the reference range length of 0.725m we determine free space path loss at f=48.2 GHz, as shown in Figure 7.1-1 below.\nFigure 7.1-1: Free space path loss vs. frequency for d=0.725m\nBased on this analysis, the relative increase in free space path loss from 43.5 GHz to 48.2 GHz is 0.9 dB.\nAnother parameter in the SNR calculation which scales with frequency is cable loss per meter.  Using the datasheets from five different commercially available RF cables, which are rated up to 50 GHz, the average cable loss per meter is calculated (averaging performed in linear gain units), as shown in Figure 7.1-2 below.\n\nFigure 7.1-2: Cable loss per meter vs. frequency\nBased on this analysis, the relative increase in cable loss per meter from 43.5 GHz to 48.2 GHz is 0.33 dB.\nThe SNR calculation related to cable loss also includes connector losses and additional margin, and it is feasible to reuse these parameters for the calculations related to band n262.\nThe SNR calculation also includes two parameters which are taken from UE RF requirements:  REFSENS and multi-band relaxation.  For REFSENS the recently agreed value of -82.8 dBm/50 MHz is used, and for MBR 1.0 dB (rounded up from 0.7 dB) is used [2].

The solution also requires relocation trigger information, decided by ECMS (ECSP Management System), to be included in EASFunction IOC.

ECMS decides to relocate an EAS for any appropriate purpose e.g. the overload of an edge compute resource, a failure or planned maintenance, a new or expanded edge compute resource, an issue with the network for its edge compute resource. \nOnce decided to relocate the EAS, ECMS considers the relocation policy and trigger information. If the EAS is to be relocated immediately and the relocation policy allows it, ECMS selects the appropriate EDN and instantiate the relocation procedure. That will include instantiating the EAS on the selected EDN as specified in TS 28.538 [6] and then terminate the existing EAS instance.

Furthermore, the NG-RAN shall keep the QoS Flow (i.e. while the NG-RAN is not fulfilling the requested QoS profile for this QoS Flow), unless specific conditions at the NG-RAN require the release of the NG-RAN resources for this GBR QoS Flow, e.g. due to Radio link failure or RAN internal congestion.

It should also be designed to enable future extensions.\n-\tPrinciple #9: Although the network does not need to know about internals of AI/ML services, it needs to be able to distinguish AI/ML related traffic from rest of the user services related traffic.

At most possible occasions for paging, no message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the network allows for the UE to 'wake up' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing much of the UE's conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What type of signal is used for wake-up in NB-IoT?

As a consequence, substantial efforts are often required to introduce new services or simply to modify the existing one (customisation). This makes it more difficult for operators to differentiate their services. At the same time however, this may reduce the complexity of providing a service across different operators' networks.\n3GPP shall therefore preferentially standardise service capabilities. In circumstances where the service is meant to be used across different operators' networks, hence a common specification set is of paramount importance, the service should be standardised to a level of detail sufficient to ensure interoperability and interworking across different operators' networks. Service capabilities consist of bearers defined by QoS parameters and the mechanisms needed to realise services. These mechanisms include the functionality provided by various network elements, the communication between them and the storage of associated data. This TS provides a conceptual description of a service architecture and architecture requirements which aim to provide service capabilities.

Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.\nFor a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.\nA connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.\nEarly data transmission (FDD)\nAn idle mode UE is able to transmit data in Msg3 of the random access procedure, carrying between 328 and 1000 bits. After successful reception by eNB, the random access procedure terminates and the UE does not transition to connected mode. The UE requests a grant for EDT if its pending data is smaller than a maximum permitted size configured by eNB, by using a pre-configured set of NPRACH resources for its preamble transmission. The eNB can allow the UE to transmit a smaller amount of data than the maximum permitted size, in order to reduce the power spent transmitting padding bits.\n\nOn MBMS-dedicated cell, the MIB-MBMS and SIB1-MBMS use a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 160 ms. Additionally, SIB1-MBMS may be scheduled in additional non-MBSFN subframes indicated in MIB-MBMS.\nFor NB-IoT, in TDD mode, the MIB-TDD-NB is transmitted on the same NB-IoT carrier as NPSS/NSSS, SystemInformationBlockType1-NB can be transmitted on NB-IoT carrier other than the MIB-NB, and the SI messages can be transmitted on a NB-IoT carrier other than the MIB-NB. At most two NB-IoT carriers are used to transmit the MIB-NB, SystemInformationBlockType1-NB and the SI messages.\nExcept for NB-IoT, the eNB may schedule DL-SCH transmissions concerning logical channels other than BCCH or BR-BCCH in the same subframe as used for BCCH or BR-BCCH. The minimum UE capability restricts the BCCH or BR-BCCH mapped to DL-SCH e.g. regarding the maximum rate.\nThe Paging message is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about a system information change. For NB-IoT UEs, BL UEs, and UEs in CE, the UE is not required to detect SIB changes when in RRC_CONNECTED, and the network may release the NB-IoT UE, BL UE or UE in CE to RRC_IDLE if it wants the NB-IoT UE, BL UE or UE in CE to acquire changed SIB(s).\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What does the Scheduling request feature in NB-IoT allow a connected mode UE to do?

The CPN via an eRG, or PIN Elements via a PIN Element with Gateway Capability can provide access to 5G network services for the UEs and/or non-3GPP devices on the CPN or PIN. CPNs and PINs have in common that in general they are owned, installed and/or (at least partially) configured by a customer of a public network operator. \nA Customer Premises Network (CPN) is a network located within a premises (e.g. a residence, office or shop). Via an evolved Residential Gateway (eRG), the CPN provides connectivity to the 5G network. The eRG can be connected to the 5G core network via wireline, wireless, or hybrid access. A Premises Radio Access Station (PRAS) is a base station installed in a CPN. Through the PRAS, UEs can get access to the CPN and/or 5G network services. The PRAS can be configured to use licensed, unlicensed, or both frequency bands. Connectivity between the eRG and the UE, non-3GPP Device, or PRAS can use any suitable non-3GPP technology (e.g. Ethernet, optical, WLAN).\n\n5.18\tControl of Customer Premises Network by Authorised Administrator\n5.18.1\tDescription\nThe Customer Premises Network (CPN), including the eRG and PRAS, is at least owned, configured and managed by the customer of a public network operator. This implies that the public network operator is at least not fully in control of the configuration and management of the eRG, PRAS and CPN.\nSome aspects of the eRG and PRAS can be under control of the public network operator. For example if the PRAS uses licensed frequencies the radio configuration will be under control of the PLMN. Another example could be network settings in the eRG for the interface to the 5G core network.\nOther settings are configured / managed by the 'customer of the public network operator'. It is proposed to specify more clearly how this configuration and management by the 'customer of the public network operator' works. We are proposing to define the role of an Authorized Administrator.

Event based charging implies that a chargeable event is defined as a single end-user-to-network transaction, e.g. the sending of a multimedia message. This chargeable event is then mapped to an appropriate charging event, resulting in a single CDR or in a single Credit-Control and resource usage authorisation procedure. In contrast, session based charging is characterised by the existence of a user session, such as a circuit call, an IP CAN bearer, an PDU session, or an IMS session. This user session is then matched by a charging session, resulting in the generation of multiple chargeable/charging events and the creation of one or more CDRs in offline charging/converged charging or the performance of a Credit-Control session in online charging/converged charging.

It will be uploaded to the MME when the E-UTRAN requests the UE Radio Capability information from the UE.\nDuring handover via the MME (both intra RAT and inter RAT), the radio capability information for the source and target 3GPP RATs (with the possible exception of UTRAN and E-UTRAN) are transferred in the \"source to target transparent container\". Information on additional 3GPP RATs is optionally transferred in the \"source to target transparent container\".\nAt handover, transfer of the radio capability information related to the source and/or additional RATs is beneficial as it avoids the need for the target RAT to retrieve the information from the UE prior to a subsequent inter-RAT handover. However, there may be situations where the size of the UE Radio Capability may be too large for the information on all of the UE's RATs to be carried in a single message on one or more of the network interfaces involved in the handover. Hence, the source RAN shall ensure that the size of the UE Radio Capability information does not cause the size of the \"source to target transparent container\" to exceed the limits that can be handled by interfaces involved in the handover (e.g. Iu interface (TS\u00a025.413\u00a0[22]) and, following SRVCC, E interface (TS\u00a029.002\u00a0[86])).

The size of the UE Radio Capability information may be greater than can be carried in single RRC message but less than the maximum size of messages on the S1 interface.

Network A is NR and Network B can either be E-UTRA or NR. Before switching from Network A, a MUSIM device should notify Network A to either leave RRC_CONNECTED state, or be kept in RRC_CONNECTED state in Network A while temporarily switching to Network B.\nWhen configured to do so, a MUSIM device can signal to the Network A a preference to leave RRC_CONNECTED state by using RRC (see TS 38.331 [12]) or NAS signalling (see TS 23.501 [3]). After sending a preference to leave RRC_CONNECTED state by using RRC signalling, if the MUSIM device does not receive an RRCRelease message from the Network A within a certain time period (configured by the Network A, see TS 38.331 [12]), the MUSIM device can enter RRC_IDLE state in Network A.\nWhen configured to do so, a MUSIM device can signal to the Network A a preference to be temporarily switching to Network B while remaining in RRC_CONNECTED state in Network. This is indicated by scheduling gaps preference. This preference can include information for setup or release of gap(s). The Network A can configure at most 4 gap patterns for MUSIM purpose: three periodic gaps and a single aperiodic gap.

Here it becomes evident that angular offset of the antenna alone is not enough to determine illumination distribution. See figure 5.3.2.2.1-10. Locations 2, 3 and 4 all have approximately the same angular offset (<0.5 degree difference), but their QZ illumination can be made better or worse than that of the on-focus source by adjusting mirror to source distance. In the graphic example, the source location closest to the mirror has the least variation QZ illumination. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the distribution of the shadow fading?

The E-UTRA can be connected to both EPC and 5GC.\nThe overall architecture of E-UTRA connected to 5GC as part of NG-RAN is described in TS\u00a038.300, where the term \"ng-eNB\" is used for E-UTRA connected to 5GC. However, here, the term \"eNB\" is used for both cases unless there is a specific need to disambiguate between eNB and ng-eNB.\nThe LTE connectivity to 5G-CN feature includes the following key functionalities:\n-\t5G NAS message transport\n-\t5G security framework, except that data integrity protection is not supported;\n\n5.3.1\tIntroduction\nAs seen above, 5G is designed to support diverse services with different data traffic profiles (e.g., high throughput, low latency and massive connections) and models (e.g., IP data traffic, non-IP data traffic, short data bursts and high throughput data transmissions). Various PDU session types are supported including IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet and Unstructured.\nThe 5G's main characteristic is the introduction of a new radio interface, the New Radio (NR), which offers the flexibility needed to support these very different types of services.\nAnother key characteristic of 5G is that the 5G Access Network can connect not only to a new 5G Core Network but also to the 4G (LTE) Core Network. This is known as the NSA architecture, while the 5G AN connected to a 5G CN is called the SA architecture.\nOn the Core Network side, the 5G System offers also a wide array of new characteristics, such as a deeper use of Network Slicing, Mobile Edge Computing or Network Capability Exposure.

URSP can be applied to support the end to end Redundant transmission, i.e. the network can provide URSP rules for applications requiring redundant transmission to the UE, with different combination of DNN and S-NSSAI. The URSP is further enhanced to include RSN and PDU Session Pair ID for the redundant transmission in Rel-17. While the Redundant Transmission on N3/N9 can be initiated by the SMF based the authorized 5QI, gNB capability and local policies.\nAs defined in the TS\u00a023.288\u00a0[5], Redundant Transmission Experience related analytics can assist the SMF for decision on Redundant Transmission on N3/N9 interface, by providing the UL/DL packet delay, packet drop rate to the SMF. However, how the end to end Redundant transmission can benefit from the Redundant Transmission Experience related analytics is undefined yet.\n\nThe I-UPFs inserted on one leg of the redundant paths shall not behave in an UL CL or Branching Point role.\n5.33.2.3\tSupport for redundant transmission at transport layer\nRedundant transmission can be supported within the 5G System without making any assumption on support for protocols such as IEEE FRER in the application layer (DN only) at the same time it can be supported without requiring redundant GTP-U tunnel over N3. The backhaul provides two disjoint transport paths between UPF and NG-RAN. The redundancy functionality within NG-RAN and UPF make use of the independent paths at transport layer. Support of redundant transmission at transport layer requires no 3GPP protocol impact.\nFollowing are the required steps:\n-\tUE establishes the PDU session for URLLC services. Based on DNN, S-NSSAI, knowledge of supporting redundant transmission at transport layer and other factors as described in clause\u00a06.3.3, SMF selects a UPF that supports redundant transmission at transport layer for the PDU session.

If the UE does not provide a DNN for a non-emergency PDU session, then the network uses the selected DNN.\nIn the UE, 5GS session management timers T3396 for DNN based congestion control are started and stopped on a per DNN basis except for an LADN DNN in case of PLMN. For an LADN DNN, 5GS session management timers T3396 for DNN based congestion control is applied to the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs. In case of SNPN, if the UE does not support access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder and equivalent SNPNs, in the UE, 5GS session management timers T3396 for DNN based congestion control are started and stopped on a per DNN and SNPN basis.

For an introduction to DCCP please refer to RFC\u00a04336\u00a0[15]. DCCP RFC\u00a04340\u00a0[11] and its multipath pendant MP-DCCP, draft-ietf-tsvwg-multipath-dccp\u00a0[12] provide protocol inherent measurement of path characteristics like latency, packet loss and available bandwidth. In that regard MP-DCCP is similar to MPTCP and therefore can support the same steering modes. Different to MPTCP though, is the handling of missing packets. Re-transmission and resulting head-of-line blocking are not under the responsibility of (MP-)DCCP, which is therefore similar to the ATSSS-LL characteristics provided for any type of traffic. This makes it suitable to be applied to Ethernet, IP and higher layer traffic when it becomes integrated with an encapsulation framework, which tunnels these types of traffic over a MP-DCCP connection. Moreover MP-DCCP provides measures to facilitate the process of re-ordering at the termination points of ATSSS. For this purpose, timing and sequencing information are transmitted along with the encapsulated data to facilitate re-ordering or partial reordering of the data received from the 3GPP and non-3GPP access. Both access types provide different path characteristics that let the original data stream scramble during transport after it has been split. Re-ordering helps in the receiving ATSSS entity (UPF or UE) to reconstruct a certain degree order.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of DNN based congestion control?

A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted.\nA remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID. Consequently, each gNB can be an aggressor and a victim at the same time.\n\nSemi-static and/or dynamic DL/UL resource assignment causes interferers between networks on adjacent channels. It has been tasked to investigate the adjacent channel co-existence effects arising when CLI, or more generically dynamic TDD is operated in an aggressor network. The technical report captures a description of the adjacent channel interference effects that arise with dynamic TDD as well as a simulation investigation of adjacent channel interference in a number of different deployment scenarios [2].\nRIM\nDue to the atmospheric ducting phenomenon, the DL signals of an aggressor cell in unpaired spectrum can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell in the same unpaired spectrum bandwidth that is far away from the aggressor cell. Such interference is termed as remote interference.

GSMA RILTE have been working with specifying multi-device solutions and asked 3GPP to create requirements for all their use cases to be specified. This work item specifies the user experience requirements for a consistent user experience when the user uses these services.\nFurthermore, the work also covers use cases where a user can allow another user (or possibly the same user) to use one or more of its identities. One example is for a user wishing to be able to use the work identity for the private phone. I.e. originated calls should show the work identity and terminating calls to the work identity should go to the private phone and include information that the work identity is called. Another example is to use a group identity, where employees can make calls on behalf of the group or firm and calls to the group are distributed to any member of the group.\n\n4.1\tIntroduction\nThe Multi-Device (MuD) service is an operator specific service which enables a user to use different UEs that are registered under the same public user identity. The UEs can be of different types (e.g. phone, tablet, wearable device, PC) and can support a communication log.\nThe Multi-Identity (MiD) service is an operator specific service which enables a user to use different identities. A served user can use a single UE to receive calls addressed to any of its identities and to make calls using any of its identities.\nThe MuD and MiD services can be used at the same time.\nThe UE can indicate to the network which identities are active at the UE.

If the AMF accepts the Paging Restriction Information from the UE, the AMF stores the Paging Restriction Information from the UE in the UE context. If the AMF rejects the Paging Restriction Information, the AMF removes any stored Paging Restriction Information from the UE context and discards the UEs requested Paging Restriction Information.

Furthermore, the maximum achievable SNR values are calculated assuming the highest band n259 frequency (f=43.5 GHz).  The highest frequency to be considered for the SNR calculation is the highest frequency of band n262:  48.2 GHz.

Some of these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections between the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for example, to allow local hosting of the services.

A method of dynamic subscription generation and management is needed in addition to statically provisioned subscription.

These requirements and the conditions can be very different from one case and implementation to the other.

Despite these differences, some of the logical links share communication devices and media. \nC.2\tCommunication service description\nC.2.1\tOverview\nTables C.2.2-1, C.2.3-1 summarise candidate interface parameters for the description of the communication service performance.

The meaning of the columns and rows is explained after each table. \nNOTE 1:\tNot all parameters in Table C.2.2-1 and Table C.2.3-1 would be used in a service call. \nNOTE 2:\tIngress and egress in this clause are in reference to the communication service interface between the source application and the communication service interface (ingress) and the communication service and the target application (egress).\n\nIn order for the automation application system to operate, messages need to be exchanged between spatially distributed application functions. For that process, messages are exchanged at an interface between the automation application system and the communication system. This interface is termed the reference interface. Required and guaranteed values for characteristic parameters, which describe the behavioural properties of the radio communication system, as well as some influence quantities refer to that interface.\nThe conditions that influence the behaviour of wireless communication are framed by the communication requirements of the application (e.g., end-to-end latency), the characteristics of the communication system (e.g., output power of a transmitter), and the transmission conditions of the media (e.g., signal fluctuations caused by multipath propagation). \nGeneral requirements from the application point of view for the time and failure behaviour of a communication system are mostly related to an end-to-end link.

Typically, numerous wireless devices such as microphones, in-ear monitoring systems or cameras are used in these scenarios. In the future, the wireless communication service for such devices are expected to be provided by a 5G system. AV production applications require a high degree of confidence, since they are related to the capturing and transmission of data at the beginning of a production chain. This differs drastically when compared to other multimedia services because the communication errors will be propagated to the entire audience that is consuming that content both live and on recorded media. Furthermore, the transmitted data is often post-processed with filters which could actually amplify defects that would be otherwise not noticed by humans. Therefore, these applications call for uncompressed or slightly compressed data, and very low probability of errors.

In order to facilitate efficient modelling of the communication network during engineering and for reducing the complexity of network optimisation, traffic classes or communication patterns have been identified [6].

Typical activity patterns for which this kind of communication is suitable are event-driven actions.\n-\tnon-deterministic communication: subsumes all other types of traffic, including periodic non-real time and aperiodic non-real time traffic. Periodicity is irrelevant in case the communication is not time-critical.\nSome communication services exhibit traffic patterns that cannot be assigned to one of the above communication patterns exclusively (mixed traffic).\n\n-\tdeterministic periodic communication; \n-\tdeterministic aperiodic communication; and \n-\tnon-deterministic communication.\nDeterministic periodic communication stands for periodic communication with stringent requirements on timeliness of the transmission.\nDeterministic aperiodic communication stands for communication without a pre-set sending time.

In the case where UE1 changes its IP address/prefix, its Target UE needs to be informed of UE1's new IP address/prefix since communication between UE1 and UE2 is IP-based. Note that the UE IP address is protected over PC5, however existing LIU procedure mandates the change of IP address for IP communications, as per TS 24.554, clause 7.3.2.4. Furthermore, the UE-to-UE Relay needs to be informed as well of UE1's new IP address/prefix since the UE-to-UE Relay handles the IP routing of messages exchanged between the UE1 and UE2. In other words, when used in the UE-to-UE Relay scenario, current LIU procedure would lead to breaking the communication between Source UE and Target UE without proper IP change handling. Therefore, LIU procedure needs enhancements for the UE-to-UE Relay scenario to correctly handle the Source UE IP address change (or Target UE IP address change if LIU procedure is run between Target UE and the UE-to-UE Relay) to avoid this issue. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What are the procedures for a Target UE\u2019s privacy exception list?

For both modes, control of uplink and downlink operation can be done by physical layer and MAC layer, within the configuration provided by the RRC layer. In single-DCI mode, the UE is scheduled by the same DCI for both TRPs and in multi-DCI mode, the UE is scheduled by independent DCIs from each TRP.\nThere are two different operation modes for multi-TRP PDCCH: PDCCH repetition as in Clause 5.2.3 and Single Frequency Network (SFN) based PDCCH transmission. In both modes, the UE can receive two PDCCH transmissions, one from each TRP, carrying the same DCI.

The solutions that have been specified include:\n-\tSemi-static CFI configuration\n-\tPDSCH repetition\n-\tUL SPS repetition\n-\tPDCP packet duplication\n-\tGranular time reference provision.\nThese solutions support configurable reliability and latency combinations and have been specified on top of the existing LTE air interface for Frame Structure type 1 (FS1) and Frame Structure type 2 (FS2), including various LTE TTI lengths (1ms, slot and subslot for FS1, 1ms and slot for FS2) as well as existing LTE latency reduction techniques.\nAn overview of the specified solutions is provided in the following.\nSemi-static CFI\nControl Format Indicator (CFI) indicates how many OFDM symbols are used for the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of the L2 latency reduction techniques for LTE work item?

Any new multimedia service, which may have a similar name or functionality to a comparable standardised service, does not necessarily have to have the same look and feel from the user's perspective of the standardised service. Voice communications (IP telephony) is one example of real-time service that would be provided as an IP multimedia application.\nThe following basic requirements are be supported for IP multimedia [27]:\n-\tIP multimedia session control shall be based on SIP [28].\n-\tAll session scenarios shall be supported; i.e. Mobile Originating and Mobile Terminating sessions against Internet/Intranet, CS or IM Mobile, ISDN, PSTN call party.\n-\tMSISDN and SIP URL numbering and addressing schemes shall be supported.\n-\tIP multimedia applications shall as a principle, not be standardised, allowing service provider specific variations.\n\n8.2\tNumbering, Naming and Addressing for SDP\nThe following URI format in the SDP exchange may be applied at the Ici as standardized in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.229\u00a0[5]:\n-\tMSRP URI for a session of instant messages defined in IETF\u00a0RFC\u00a04975\u00a0[17].\nThis URI format shall be supported at the roaming II-NNI and may be supported at the non-roaming II-NNI and for the loopback traversal scenario based on agreement between operators. Other URI formats may be supported over the II-NNI depending on the operator's agreements.\n9\tIP Version\nThe network elements interconnected by means of the II-NNI may support IPv4 only, IPv6 only or both.\nThe support of one or both of the IP versions is an operator option and should be based on bilateral agreement.\nIn case IPv4 and IPv6 networks are interconnected, the involved IBCFs and TrGWs shall apply the IP version interworking procedures as indicated in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.162\u00a0[8].\n10\tSecurity\nThe supported security mechanisms for IP signalling transport over II-NNI interfaces are described in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.210\u00a0[10].\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which of the following numbering and addressing schemes are supported for IP multimedia sessions?

New transport block sizes and transport block size scaling were introduced to support 64-QAM. In addition, transmission uses rate-matching instead of the Rel-14 procedure where the last symbol was punctured.\n-\tReduction of the maximum time between packet arrival at Layer 1 and resource selected for transmission. This value was reduced to 10ms, compared to 20ms for Rel-14 V2X.\n-\tRadio resource pool sharing between mode-3 and mode-4 UEs. Changes in the SCI content for mode-3 UEs were introduced to improve performance when resource pools are shared. Sensing and reporting for mode-3 UEs is supported.\n-\tTransmit diversity. After studies, it was concluded that transmit diversity was a valuable feature to have. The transmit diversity technique used is Small Delay Cyclic Delay Diversity.\n-\tRF requirements for new CA scenarios, 64QAM and transmit diversity were introduced in TS\u00a036.101.\n-\tRRM requirements. The delay/interruption requirements due to V2X CC addition/release and V2X synchronization reference source selection/reselection requirements for V2X CA was introduced.\n\n8.2\tEnhancements on LTE-based V2X Services\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-180858.\nIn Rel-14, TSG RAN completed the WI \"Support for V2V services based on LTE sidelink\" and the WI \"LTE-based V2X services\". With these the completion of these two WIs, TSG RAN had specified V2X communication in order to provide basic safety services.\nIn Rel-15, the LTE_eV2X work item enhances the Cellular-based V2X services (V2V, V2I/N, and V2P) to support advanced V2X services as identified in TR\u00a022.886 in a holistic and complementary manner to Release 14 V2X. This work item specifies 3GPP V2X Phase 2 to support advanced V2X services in a fully backward compatible manner with Rel-14 V2X. \nThese studies concluded to specify and introduce the following key functionalities:\n-\tSupport of Carrier Aggregation (CA) for mode-4. CA was already supported for mode-3 in Rel-14. In Rel-15, CA for mode-4 was specified. The resource allocation procedure of Rel-14, which was based on sensing, was expanded to support multi-carrier transmission, while relying on the same core principles. Rules for power sharing, and to include priority were derived. A synchronization procedure for multiple carriers was derived. It includes priority rules for determining the synchronization resources. Sidelink packet duplication was introduced in the case of CA to improve the transmission reliability.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What was the transmit diversity technique used in Rel-15 for V2X Phase 2?
