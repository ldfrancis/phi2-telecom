Non-anchor carrier operation\nThere can be up to 15 DL and UL non-anchor carriers configured in a new NB-IoT SIB, used by paging, RAR, or SC-PTM, each identified by its centre frequency. For paging purposes, POs are distributed across the non-anchor carriers in a configurable uneven manner so that the eNB can decide what paging load each carrier should have. For random access, each non-anchor UL carrier has a probability with which the UE may randomly select it for Msg1&3, and corresponds to a DL carrier for Msg2&4; or for ordered random access the carrier for Msg1&3 is indicated by DCI. Contention free random access is supported for NPDCCH ordered random access.\nOn non-anchor carriers for receiving paging and RAR, the subframes which the UE can assume contain NRS are reduced, to benefit network power consumption and co-existence with LTE and NR in future. In addition to spanning a few valid subframes either side of the NPDSCH carrying paging or RAR, the NRS are reduced to start a few valid subframes before the paging NPDCCH search space or RAR window, and continue until a few valid subframes after the NPDCCH candidate that contains the paging DCI, or after the RAR window respectively.\n\nMixed standalone operation (FDD)\nIn Rel-13, a standalone anchor or non-anchor NB-IoT carrier can only be configured together with another standalone carrier. This feature allows configuration of standalone anchor carriers with in-band and guard-band non-anchor carriers, and of in-band and guard-band anchor carriers with standalone non-anchor carriers. This allows small slices of non-LTE spectrum to be used as a standalone NB-IoT carrier and be linked with NB-IoT carriers associated to LTE spectrum.\nPower headroom reporting enhancement (FDD)\nIn Rel-13, power headroom reports (PHR) are made by the UE from one of two tables depending on coverage, each containing four entries. This feature improves the granularity of PHR transmitted in Msg3 to have 16 levels.\nTDD\nSupport for TDD is introduced, incorporating the Rel-13 NB-IoT feature together with Rel-14 features: UE category NB2, 2 UL/DL HARQ processes, multi-carrier RACH and paging, and OTDOA [1]. All LTE UL/DL subframe configurations are supported, except for configurations 0 and 6, and all LTE special subframe configurations are supported.

The RAN WI enhances this so that a UE operating PC5 based V2X can transmit and receive SLSS (SideLink Synchronization Signal)\n3GPP\nRelease 14\t27\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)\nwhich can be used as another type of synchronization reference in sidelink communications. Two UEs using the same SLSS as their synchronization reference can align their time and frequency references before transmitting and receiving V2X messages even when no GNSS signal or eNB signal is detected.\nSupport of simultaneous V2X operations over multiple carriers\nThe RAN WI extends the V2X operation scenarios by supporting simultaneous V2X operations over multiple carriers. In one scenario, a UE can operate LTE-Uu based V2X in a carrier while operating PC5 based V2X in another carrier. In another scenario, a UE can operate PC5 based V2X simultaneously over two carriers. Tables 7.1-1 and 7.1-2 list the combinations of V2X carriers supported for V2X services. The RAN WI specifies a mechanism to determine the transmission power of each carrier based on the priority level. Such simultaneous V2X operations can be used to increase the maximum bandwidth of the V2X services or to support inter-PLMN operations where multiple operators provide V2X services over different carriers.\n\nFigure 5.10.7.1-1: Synchronisation information transmission for sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication, in (partial) coverage\nFigure 5.10.7.1-2: Synchronisation information transmission for sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication / sidelink discovery, out of coverage\nFigure 5.10.7.1-3: Synchronisation information transmission for sidelink discovery, in (partial) coverage\nThe purpose of this procedure is to provide synchronisation information to a UE.

Two functionalities are introduced:\n\"UE-assisted DCN selection\", as to reduce the DECOR re-routing;\nand in E-UTRAN, a mechanism is introduced to improve the load balancing between MMEs when DCN is used.\nThis work item specifies the use of DCN-ID (Dedicated Core Network \u2013 Identity) to assist the RAN (GERAN, UTRAN and E-UTRAN) in selecting the correct DCN, as to reduce the use of DECOR re-routing. The DCN-ID is allocated by the core network and sent to the UE in the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) \"accept\" messages. The DCN-ID is stored in the UE per PLMN. The UE provides the DCN-ID in the RRC message in Attach Request, Tracking Area Update Request (TAU) or Routing Area Update Request (RAU) messages. If the RAN cannot find a serving MME/SGSN related to GUTI, NRI, etc. provided by the UE, RAN uses the DCN-ID to select correct MME/SGSN serving the requested DCN.

Generally, this property is built into the network capability, or service, that the NE provides, and described in the middle tier TSs.\n5.2.1.1\tTransfer of charging events via Rf\nIn event based charging, a network / user event (e.g. MM submission) corresponds to a single chargeable event.

Other MS may enter the limited service state.\nNOTE\u00a01:\tIn A/Gb mode, in a SoLSA exclusive cell the MCC+MNC code is replaced by a unique escape PLMN code (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.073), not assigned to any PLMN, in SI3 and SI4. An MS not supporting SoLSA may request for location update to an exclusive access cell. In this case the location attempt is rejected with the cause \"PLMN not allowed\" and the escape PLMN code is added to the list of the \"forbidden PLMNs\".\n\nIf the MS loses coverage of a cell, or find a more suitable cell, it reselects onto the most suitable cell of the selected PLMN or SNPN and camps on that cell. If the new cell is in a different registration area, an LR request is performed.\nIf the MS loses coverage of a PLMN or SNPN, either a new PLMN or SNPN is selected automatically, or an indication of which PLMNs or SNPNs are available is given to the user, so that a manual selection can be made.\nRegistration is not performed by MSs only capable of services that need no registration.\nThe purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode is fourfold:\na)\tIt enables the MS to receive system information from the PLMN or SNPN.\nb)\tIf the MS wishes to initiate a call, it can do this by initially accessing the network on the control channel of the cell on which it is camped.\nc)\tIf the PLMN or SNPN receives a call for the MS, it knows (in most cases) the registration area of the cell in which the MS is camped. It can then send a \"paging\" message for the MS on control channels of all the cells in the registration area. The MS will then receive the paging message because it is tuned to the control channel of a cell in that registration area, and the MS can respond on that control channel.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('In A/Gb mode, a cell may be reserved for exclusive access by SoLSA.

This includes aspects like closed-loop control applications (e.g., based on programmable logic or motion controllers) and robotics, as well as aspects of computer-integrated manufacturing. Factory automation generally represents a key enabler for industrial mass production with high quality and cost-efficiency. Corresponding applications are often characterised by highest requirements on the underlying communication infrastructure, especially in terms of communication service availability, determinism, and latency. In the Factories of the Future, static sequential production systems will be more and more replaced by novel modular production systems offering a high flexibility and versatility. This involves many increasingly mobile production assets, for which powerful wireless communication and localisation services are required. \n2)\tProcess automation: Process automation refers to the control of production and handling of substances like chemicals, food & beverage, pulp, etc. Process automation improves the efficiency of production processes, energy consumption, and safety of the facilities. Sensors measuring process values, such as pressures or temperatures, are working in closed loops via centralised and decentralised controllers. In turn, the controllers interact with actuators, e.g., valves, pumps, heaters. Also, monitoring of attributes such as the filling levels of tanks, quality of material, or environmental data are important, as well as safety warnings or plant shut downs. Workers in the plant are supported by mobile devices. A process automation facility may range from a few 100\u00a0m\u00b2 to several km\u00b2, and the facility may be geographically distributed. Depending on the size, a production plant may have several 10,000 measurement points and actuators. Autarkic device power supply for years is needed in order to stay flexible and to keep the total costs of ownership low. \n\nD.1 \tFactory automation \u2013 motion control\nD.1.0\t\tGeneral\nFactory automation requires communications for closed-loop control applications. Examples for such applications are motion control of robots, machine tools, as well as packaging and printing machines. All other factory automation applications are addressed in Annex D.2.\nThe corresponding industrial communication solutions are referred to as fieldbuses. The pertinent standard suite is IEC 61158. Note that clock synchronization is an integral part of fieldbuses that support motion control use cases.\nIn motion control applications, a controller interacts with a large number of sensors and actuators (e.g. up to 100) that are integrated in a manufacturing unit. The resulting sensor/actuator density is often very high (up to 1 m-3). Many such manufacturing units have to be supported within close proximity within a factory (e.g. up to 100 in automobile assembly line production).\nIn a closed-loop control application, the controller periodically submits instructions to a set of sensor/actuator devices, which return a response within a so-called cycle time. The messages, which are referred to as telegrams, are typically small (\u2264 56\u00a0bytes). The cycle time can be as low as 2 ms, setting stringent end-to-end latency constraints on telegram forwarding (\u2264 1\u00a0ms). Additional constraints on isochronous telegram delivery add tight constraints on the lateness (1\u00a0\uf06ds), and the communication service has also to be highly available (99,9999%). \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What are the considerations for closed-loop factory automation?

Open-loop control is characterised by one or many messages sent to an actuator. These can be sent in a periodic or an aperiodic pattern. However, the communication means used need to be deterministic since typically an activity response from the receiver and/or the receiving application is expected. \nClosed-loop control produces both periodic and aperiodic communication patterns. Closed-loop control is often used for the control of continuous processes with tight time-control limits, e.g., the control of a printing press. In this case, one typically relies on periodic communication patterns. Note that in both the aperiodic and periodic case, the communication needs to be deterministic. \nLogging of device states, measurements, etc. for maintenance purposes and such typically entails aperiodic communication patterns. In case the transmitted logging information can be time-stamped by the respective function, determinism is often not mandatory. \n\n5.2\tPeriodic deterministic communication\nPeriodic deterministic communication is periodic with stringent requirements on timeliness and availability of the communication service. A transmission occurs every transfer interval. A description of periodic deterministic communication can be found in Clauses 4.3 and 4.4.

Data transmissions associated with said scheduling assignments are occupying adjacent RBs in the same subframe. Note that another variant where SA and associated data transmissions are not necessarily transmitted on adjacent RBs has also been standardized.\n3GPP\nRelease 14\t29\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)\nFigure 7.2-2: new arrangement of scheduling assignment and data resources\nFinally for distributed scheduling (a.k.a. Mode 4) a sensing with semi-persistent transmission based mechanism was introduced. V2V traffic from a device is mostly periodic in nature. This was utilized to sense congestion on a resource and estimate future congestion on that resource. Based on estimation resources were booked. This technique optimizes the use of the channel by enhancing resource separation between transmitters that are using overlapping resources.\n\nArchitecture enhancements\nThe Work Item on \"Architecture enhancements for LTE support of V2X services (V2XARC)\", driven by SA WG2, specifies the V2X architectures, functional entities involved for V2X communication, interfaces, provisioned parameters and procedures in TS 23.285 [2].\n3GPP\nRelease 14\t23\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)\nFigure 7.1-2 depicts an overall architecture for V2X communication.

S8HR is an architecture for IMS voice roaming where, even though the UE is roaming in a VPLMN, all the following entities are located in the HPLMN: PGW, PCRF, ATCF, ATGW, P-CSCF, S-CSCF and TAS.\nOne of the main implications is that the S8HR roaming architecture is not using the Local Breakout anymore and, therefore, the IMS APN is resolved to point to a PGW in the HPLMN.

The analytics consumer NF or the Decision Enforcement NF, can provide feedback of the execution result (e.g. based on changes of relevant KPIs of the NF) of a decided action based on the effect of the predicted analytics ID.\n5.\tThe NWDAF (AnLF) detects whether there is need for improvement of an Analytics ID, which is leading to unstable network status. By comparing monitored analytics ID performance information with the criteria of the correctness of an analytics ID (i.e. that have been provided by the analytics consumer or set in the NWDAF), the NWDAF calculate the Analytics ID grade information. The NWDAF will decide whether the correction is needed according to the Analytics ID grade information. The unstable Analytics ID information already known are also taken into account.\n\tThe NWDAF (AnLF) can also associate  the Analytics ID performance information, and the internal configuration for an analytics ID, via a tracing function included in the NWDAF (AnLF). The NWDAF (AnLF) can keep information about last known stable the Analytics ID performance information, which isstable at a given point in time when using a given analytics with the most appropriated configuration.

The applicable deployment scenarios are described in Annex B.3.\nThe gNB performs channel access mode procedures as described in TS 37.213 [37]. The gNB and the UE may apply Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) before performing a transmission on a cell configured with shared spectrum channel access. When LBT is applied, the transmitter listens to/senses the channel to determine whether the channel is free or busy and performs transmission only if the channel is sensed free.\nWhen the UE detects consistent uplink LBT failures, it takes actions as specified in TS 38.321 [6]. The detection is per Bandwidth Part (BWP) and based on all uplink transmissions within this BWP. When consistent uplink LBT failures are detected on SCell(s), the UE reports this to the corresponding gNB (MN for MCG, SN for SCG) via MAC CE on a different serving cell than the SCell(s) where the failures were detected. If no resources are available to transmit the MAC CE, a Scheduling Request (SR) can be transmitted by the UE. When consistent uplink LBT failures are detected on SpCell, the UE switches to another UL BWP with configured RACH resources on that cell, initiates RACH, and reports the failure via MAC CE. When multiple UL BWPs are available for switching, it is up to the UE implementation which one to select. For PSCell, if consistent uplink LBT failures are detected on all the UL BWPs with configured RACH resources, the UE declares SCG RLF and reports the failure to the MN via SCGFailureInformation. For PCell, if the uplink LBT failures are detected on all the UL BWP(s) with configured RACH resources, the UE declares RLF.\n\n5.7.0\tGeneral\nCarrier aggregation with at least one SCell operating in the unlicensed spectrum is referred to as Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA).

In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.\n\n-\tCritical Communications (CC) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC): Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very high communications service availability. These are driven by the new services such as industrial automation. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a server which may be outside the 5G system, and data processing. Some of these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections between the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for example, to allow local hosting of the services. The scenarios and their performance requirements can be found in table 7.2.2-1 of TS\u00a022.261\u00a0[1].

Network slicing standardization has progressed in various different 3GPP Working Groups. Specification related to this feature includes architecture, orchestration and management, network resource models, capability management and exposure. The Key Issues studied in the present document point to a need to extend the 5GMS architecture in order to take advantage of network slicing when delivering 5G Media Streaming services.\nThe present document provides an overview of network slicing architecture and aspects related to slice orchestration and management as well as network slice capability exposure. It briefly describes different network slice management options such as operator-managed network slicing and third-party-managed network slicing. The present document also collects a set of use cases for running 5G Media Streaming services in one or more network slices, and describes a number of collaboration scenarios for exploiting network slicing capabilities within the 5GMS architecture. It also documents key issues and candidate solutions related to service provisioning, moving media flows to other network slices, and bootstrapping application invocation on a network slice.\n\n5.12.2\tCollaboration Scenarios\nEditor\u2019s Note: Study collaboration scenarios between the 5G System and Application Provider for each of the key topics.\n5.12.3\tDeployment Architectures\nEditor\u2019s Note: Based on the 5GMS Architecture, develop one or more deployment architectures that address the key topics and the collaboration models.\n5.12.4\tMapping to 5G Media Streaming and High-Level Call Flows\nEditor\u2019s Note: Map the key topics to basic functions and develop high-level call flows.\n5.12.5\tPotential open issues\nThe following potential open issues are identified:\n1)\tUsage of network slicing identification information as part of service provisioning information (M1)\n2)\tApplicable stage 2 and stage 3 aspects related to impact to QoS specification during service provisioning because of network slicing\n3)\tUsage of network slicing identification information during dynamic policy procedures (M5)\n4)\tApplicable stage 2 and stage 3 aspects related to impact to QoS specification because of network slicing in dynamic policy procedures \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which aspect of the 5G system covers network slicing, network capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility, security, efficient content delivery, and migration and interworking?

UE LCS privacy is a feature which allows a UE and/or AF to control which LCS clients and AFs are and are not allowed access to UE location information. UE LCS privacy can be supported via subscription and via UE LCS privacy profile handling.\nWith subscription, privacy preferences for a UE are stored in a UE LCS privacy profile as part of UE subscription data in the UDM and queried from the UDM by another NF such as GMLC or NEF. The UDM may also store the UE privacy profile in the UDR. In this release of the specification, subscription of privacy preferences is restricted to the Call/Session unrelated Class as defined in clause\u00a05.4.2.2.3 and the PLMN Operator Class as defined in clause\u00a05.4.2.2.4.\nWith UE LCS privacy profile handling, the UE and/or AF can provide and update part of the UE privacy profile and provide it to the network as an update to the UDR.

In general the accuracy of the location depends on the positioning technology used, the varying radio environments (e.g. considering multipath propagation), the type of environment where the location is measured (dense urban area or rural area).\nThe location accuracy required by each service varies and can vary from location accuracy up to 200km for weather services to location accuracy of up to 50m for Asset Location, route guidance, navigation. Further information is provided in Table 4.1 of TS\u00a022.071\u00a0[18].\nWhen a location client requires a location accuracy the location client may include in the request to the GMLC:\n-\tA response time (no delay, low delay, delay tolerant).\n-\tHorizontal and/or vertical accuracy requirements (in meters).\n\n4.7\tKey issue\u00a0#7: Support for location accuracy analytics \nAccording to SA1 TS 22.261 (6.27) and TS 22.104, positioning services aim to support verticals and applications with positioning accuracies better than 10 meters, thus more accurate than the ones of TS 22.071 for LCS. High accuracy positioning is characterized by ambitious system requirements for positioning accuracy in many verticals and applications, including regulatory needs. For example, on the factory floor, it is important to locate assets and moving objects such as forklifts, or parts to be assembled. Similar needs exist in transportation and logistics, for example rail, road and use of UAVs. In some road user cases, UE's supporting V2X application(s) are also applicable to such needs. In cases such as guided vehicles (e.g. industry, UAVs) and positioning of objects involved in safety-related functions, availability needs to be very high. In SA1, different service levels are mapped to different positioning performance attributes including vertical and horizontal accuracies. Such accuracies (e.g. cm-level, dm-level, meter-level) may depend on the positioning methods which are used, the LCS producers, as well as the UE mobility and the environment. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What factors can affect the accuracy of location services?

On the one hand, if small amounts are reserved, the NE must renew the authorisation very frequently, creating high signalling and processing loads. Additionally, this policy has a comparatively high likelihood of longer, or higher-value, user sessions being forcefully terminated due to expiry of the subscriber account after many small quotas have been used for small chunks of the subscriber session.

Legacy 3GPP-based technologies and solutions can be beneficial to the digitalisation and mobilisation of the maritime domain though some of the legacy 3GPP enabling technologies and solutions may not be able to fully support the performances required by the maritime domain.

VRUP provides warning to vehicles of the presence of vulnerable road users, e.g. pedestrian or cyclist, in case of dangerous situation.

Such messages can be standard VRU messages (e.g. VAM) and other V2X messages (CAM, DENM, BSM, CPM) and can be exchanged via different transmission modes (unicast, groupcast, broadcast).\nIn such scenario, one challenge is that a pedestrian UE might have a lower battery capacity and limited radio capability, and therefore may have to work in a low power consumption mode, e.g. not being able to send/receive V2X messages with the same periodicity as a Vehicular UE.

It is independent on the EAP method in use but it permits a re-authentication based on key material (unexpired) derived from a previous authentication. As for the Fast re-authentication method (clause 6.3), it re-uses the key derived from the previous full authentication. It does not involve the HSS, nor the credentials used by EAP-AKA' and does not involve the handling of EAP-AKA' authentication vectors, which makes the procedure faster and reduces the load on (the 3GPP AAA server and) the HSS and, in particular the Authentication Centre. \nThe ERP protocol permits to perform the re-authentication process at the 3GPP AAA Server avoiding signalling on SWx. It also permits to delegate the re-authentication process to the TWAP (Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy) avoiding signalling on STa (and SWd in case of roaming) or to the 3GPP AAA Proxy avoiding signalling on SWd, thus reducing the load as well on the 3GPP AAA server. \nTo use ERP, the basic assumption is that ERP is supported by the WLAN. For non-roaming scenarios, the ER server (as described in IETF RFC 6696[x]) may reside in the TWAP or the 3GPP AAA server. In roaming scenarios, there is an additional case where the ER server resides within the 3GPP AAA Proxy.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which 3GPP working group is responsible for the security aspects of the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)?

The architecture allows for a quiet zone (QZ) roughly the size of the spot on the mirror illuminated by the source. The key to this architecture is locating the source at the focus of the parabola that describers the mirror.\nThe burgeoning number of FR2 bands place increasing demands on both, the antenna, as well as the RFFE in test equipment.\nThe effect of off-focus test system antenna in IFF systems was studied before listing ramifications to inter-band test requirements. The components of the IFF are much larger than the wavelength of signals under test. The primary effect of the EM solution to the IFF problem can hence be determined by an equivalent optics problem.  \nFrom the geometry of a parabola, there is a unique location (the focus) that allows a test antenna to appear as a far-field antenna after reflection off the mirror. The far-field characteristic comes from the wavefront geometry that is transformed by the mirror from spherical to planar. The planar wavefront is normal to the optical axis of the mirror. Unfortunately, the favorable characteristics of the parabolic mirror are limited to proper placement of the source, and optical aberration is expected outside the geometry demands specific to the mirror in use. For example, in astronomy, the \u2018coma\u2019 aberration has long been associated with telescopes when wavefronts of incoming light are not normal to the optical axis.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which test system is impacted by off-focus antenna?

If remote interference is detected, the gNB-DU can send out the RIM-RS. In the aggressor set, if a gNB-DU detects the RIM-RS sent by the victim gNB(s), it sends to the gNB-CU the RIM-RS detection status and the victim Set ID. The gNB-CU acts as a coordinator on behalf of its affiliated gNB-DUs, where the gNB-CU merges the outgoing RIM information received from its gNB-DUs in the aggressor set and forwards the merged information to all the gNBs in the victim set.\nSimilarly, in the victim set, the gNB-CU distributes the incoming RIM information to all the gNB-DUs in the set, as indicated in the RIM information received from the aggressor set.\nIn addition, to facilitate consolidation of RIM information, the gNB-DU provides the associated aggressor set ID and the victim set ID of each serving cell to the gNB-CU.\n\n17\tInterference Management\n17.1\tRemote Interference Management\nThe atmospheric ducting phenomenon, caused by lower densities at higher altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, causes a reduced refractive index, causing the signals to bend back towards the Earth. A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted.\nA remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID.

The main control functions of automated control systems include taking measurements, comparing results, computing any detected or anticipated errors, and correcting the process to avoid future errors. These functions are performed by sensors, transmitters, controllers, and actuators.\nCyber-physical systems are to be understood as systems that include engineered, interacting networks of physical and computational components. Cyber-physical control applications are to be understood as applications that control physical processes. Cyber-physical control applications in automation follow certain activity patterns, which are open-loop control, closed-loop control, sequence control, and batch control.\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Siemens in SP-220458.\nCyber-physical control applications in vertical domains (CAV) was introduced in Rel-16  [2]. As a reminder, \"cyber-physical control applications\" refers to applications that control physical processes over a network, using algorithms. Communication for cyber-physical control applications supports operation in various vertical domains, for instance industrial automation, Smart Grid. CAV requires very high levels of communication service availability and some of them also require a very low end-to-end latency as well as real-time capabilities. \nRel-17\u2019s enhancements for CAV (eCAV) refines the service requirements for CAV and specifies new service requirements for specific aspects (Stage 1): additional service performance requirements (KPIs, influencing parameters) have been provided for enhanced and new use cases of cyber-physical control applications: control-to-control communication, wired-to-wireless link replacement (100 Mbit/s, 1 Gbit/s), cooperative carrying, mobile operation panels, and industrial wireless sensors.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What are the four activity patterns in cyber-physical control applications in automation?

The communication service availability depends on the latency and reliability (in the context of network layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 [2]) of the logical communication link, as well as the survival time of the cyber-physical application (see Annex C.3 for further details on these relations).\nThe communication service reliability requirements also depend on the operation characteristics of the corresponding cyber-physical applications. Typically, the communication services critical for the automation application also come with stringent communication service reliability requirements. Note that the communication service reliability requirement has no direct relationship with the communication service availability requirement.\nThe \"# of UEs\" in the tables in clauses 5.2 to 5.5 is intended to give an indication of the UE density that would need to be served within a given service area.\n\nFigure F-1: Illustration of the concepts reliability and communication service availability.\nAs depicted, reliability covers the communication-related aspects between two nodes (here: end nodes), while communication service availability addresses the communication-related aspects between two communication service interfaces. This might seem to be a small difference, but this difference can lead to situations, where reliability and communication service availability have different values.\nExample: traffic gets \"stuck\"\nThe related scenario is depicted in figure F-2.\nFigure F-2: Example in which reliability and communication service availability have different values. Packets are reliably transmitted from the communication service interface A to end node B, but they are not exposed at the communication service interface B.\nThis scenario addresses unicast communication from application A to B. The packets are handed over at the communication service interface A from the application to the communication network, and the packets are then transmitted to the end node B. In this example, the packets received by end node B are not exposed at the communication service interface B. So, even if all packets that are handed over to end node A are successfully delivered to end node B within the time constraint required by the targeted service (reliability = 100 %), the communication service availability is 0% since no packets arrive at the \"end\", namely the communication service interface B.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('Which scenario is characterized by high requirements on the communications system regarding communication service availability?

In contrast to LTE, OFDM can also be used in the NR uplink (UL) direction. As a complement waveform with lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) to improve UL coverage, DFT-s-OFDM (OFDM with Discrete Fourier Transform precoding) can be used in the uplink although limited to single-layer transmission only.\nTo cope with various deployment scenarios, NR supports a wide range of carrier frequencies (within two possible ranges) and channel bandwidths, as shown in the table below.\nTable 5.5.4.1-1: NR channel bandwidth\nTo allow for such a flexibility, NR uses a flexible frame structure, with different Subcarrier Spacings (SCS). The SCS is the distance between the centres of two consecutive subcarriers, and the possible values for SCS are (in kHz): 15; 30; 60; 120 and 240. This is referred to as \"multiple numerologies\".\nA consecutive series of 12 subcarriers forms one Resource Block (RB). An NR channel bandwidth consists of a number of RBs. A Resource Element (RE) is defined as a unit of one subcarrier (frequency domain) and one OFDM symbol (time domain).\n\n25) if the access-class field is equal to \"3GPP-NR-SAT\", a \"utran-cell-id-3gpp\" parameter set to a concatenation of the MCC (3 decimal digits), MNC (2 or 3 decimal digits depending on MCC value), Tracking Area Code (6 hexadecimal digits) as described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3], the NR Cell Identity (NCI) (9 hexadecimal digits) and optionally, the NID (11 hexadecimal digits) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3].
