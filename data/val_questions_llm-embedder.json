As an example, a WLAN access network may utilize EAP re-authentication in order to enable Fast Initial Link Setup (specified in IEEE 802.11ai) and minimize the link-setup delay between the UE and the WLAN access network.\nAn EPC network may optionally support EAP re-authentication for interworking with non-3GPP accesses. Also, the UE may optionally support EAP re-authentication. By using EAP re-authentication, UEs can connect to EPC via non-3GPP access and utilize EPC services with enhanced performance. For example, a UE may experience improved voice-over-IMS service due to the small link-setup delay that occurs when the UE transitions between access points in the non-3GPP access network.\nWhen an EPC network supports EAP re-authentication, the functionality of the 3GPP AAA server/proxy and the procedures over STa, SWa and SWd interfaces shall be enhanced in order to support the applicable procedures specified in RFC\u00a06696\u00a0[85]. Also, when a UE supports EAP re-authentication, the UE shall be enhanced in order to support the functionality of the EAP re-authentication peer RFC\u00a06696\u00a0[85]. EAP re-authentication over the SWu interface (i.e. when the UE establishes a secure connection with the ePDG) is not applicable.\n\n6.6.1\tIntroduction\nThe EAP Re-authentication protocol (ERP) is specified in IETF\u00a0RFC\u00a06696\u00a0[x]. It is independent on the EAP method in use but it permits a re-authentication based on key material (unexpired) derived from a previous authentication. As for the Fast re-authentication method (clause 6.3), it re-uses the key derived from the previous full authentication. It does not involve the HSS, nor the credentials used by EAP-AKA' and does not involve the handling of EAP-AKA' authentication vectors, which makes the procedure faster and reduces the load on (the 3GPP AAA server and) the HSS and, in particular the Authentication Centre. \nThe ERP protocol permits to perform the re-authentication process at the 3GPP AAA Server avoiding signalling on SWx. It also permits to delegate the re-authentication process to the TWAP (Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy) avoiding signalling on STa (and SWd in case of roaming) or to the 3GPP AAA Proxy avoiding signalling on SWd, thus reducing the load as well on the 3GPP AAA server. \nTo use ERP, the basic assumption is that ERP is supported by the WLAN. For non-roaming scenarios, the ER server (as described in IETF RFC 6696[x]) may reside in the TWAP or the 3GPP AAA server. In roaming scenarios, there is an additional case where the ER server resides within the 3GPP AAA Proxy.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of the Support of EAP Re-authentication Protocol for WLAN Interworking feature?

The solutions that have been specified include:\n-\tSemi-static CFI configuration\n-\tPDSCH repetition\n-\tUL SPS repetition\n-\tPDCP packet duplication\n-\tGranular time reference provision.\nThese solutions support configurable reliability and latency combinations and have been specified on top of the existing LTE air interface for Frame Structure type 1 (FS1) and Frame Structure type 2 (FS2), including various LTE TTI lengths (1ms, slot and subslot for FS1, 1ms and slot for FS2) as well as existing LTE latency reduction techniques.\nAn overview of the specified solutions is provided in the following.\nSemi-static CFI\nControl Format Indicator (CFI) indicates how many OFDM symbols are used for the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.\n\n-\tSemistatic CFI: A semistatic value for CFI (which determines the number of symbols to be used for PDCCH in a given subframe) is indicated in MIB. This allows the UE to skip PCFICH decoding, which can become the bottleneck in low SINR conditions.\n-\tAggregation level 16: Before Rel-16, the maximum aggregation level for PDCCH was 8. Rel-16 introduces aggregation level 16 (only for MBMS dedicated cells) to enhance performance in low SINR conditions.\n-\tPBCH repetition: Similar to the scheme defined for eMTC (but with additional symbol-level rotation for interference randomization), PBCH is repeated in CAS.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in: \nhttps://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=830076,800091,830176,830276 \n[1]\tRP-193050: \u201cRevised WID on LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast\u201d, RAN#86\n[2] \tRP-160675, \u201cNew WID: eMBMS enhancements for LTE\u201d\n[3] \tTR\u00a038.913: \"Study on scenarios and requirements for next generation access technologies\"\n[4]\tTR\u00a036.776: \u201cEvolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Study on LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast\u201d\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of the Semi-static CFI configuration in LTE?

During the congestion period, the continuous less importance data from the UPF to the RAN may cause the RAN more congested and waste the transport layer resource between the RAN and the UPF. The UPF can also drop some less important data to the RAN when RAN is congested. Besides, the existing FAR has supported to block or buffer chose data at the UPF.\nHence, the solution proposes to make UPF not to transmit the less important DL data to the RAN when the RAN congestion happens.\nBesides, in some XRM service, P frame and B frame are also important as I frame to construct the fluent video, dropping of those P frame and B frame causes jitter to the QoE which is not better than giving up the whole service. In some other XRM service, P frame and B frame are used to enhance the high definition, e.g. from 720p to 1080p. dropping of those P frame and B frame makes sense to keep the service when the network resource cannot transmit all of the service data.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What happens during times of severe congestion when it is necessary to drop packets on a media QoS Flow?

Typically, numerous wireless devices such as microphones, in-ear monitoring systems or cameras are used in these scenarios. In the future, the wireless communication service for such devices are expected to be provided by a 5G system. AV production applications require a high degree of confidence, since they are related to the capturing and transmission of data at the beginning of a production chain. This differs drastically when compared to other multimedia services because the communication errors will be propagated to the entire audience that is consuming that content both live and on recorded media. Furthermore, the transmitted data is often post-processed with filters which could actually amplify defects that would be otherwise not noticed by humans. Therefore, these applications call for uncompressed or slightly compressed data, and very low probability of errors. These devices will also be used alongside existing technologies which have a high level of performance and so any new technologies will need to match or improve upon the existing workflows to drive adoption of the technology.\n\n        \nFigure E.2-1: Typical AVPROD setup\nThe microphones and cameras can be co-located in a broadcast centre in which case they would communicate through a LAN or NPN. For remote production operations the mixing and production console may be separated by some distance (existing examples are cross continental. In this instance they may communicate via a PLMN or combination of PLMN and WAN networks.\nSome approaches may also deploy main (leader) equipment at the broadcast centre with secondary (follower) equipment at the location site to reduce latency. \nOther aspects of this workflow may also include robotic control where both the physical position (height, direction and tilt) and the technical control (focus, zoom, iris, colour) of a device of a camera, microphone or light may be controlled remotely. In this instance round trip latency of < 20ms is required in order for an operator to see a move reflected at his control position as it is made.\nIt is important to note that these are a combination of automated robotics (pre-programmed moves) and manually controlled robotics (following an unpredictable event such a sport).\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the main concern in AV production applications?

This KPI is defined in TS 28.554 [18] clause 6.7.2.2.\n- Energy efficiency of eMBB network slice \u2013 RAN-based, where the performance of the network slice is is obtained by summing up UL and DL data volumes at F1-U, Xn-U and X2-U interface(s) of gNBs, on a per S-NSSAI basis, divided by energy consumption of the RAN-only network slice.

Multimedia Priority Service allows authorized users to obtain and maintain radio and network resources with priority, also during national security or emergency situations when PLMN congestion may occur.\nMPS session: A session (e.g. voice, video, data session) for which priority treatment is applied for allocating and maintaining radio and network resources.\nMPS-subscribed UE: A UE having a USIM with MPS subscription.\nNAT-PT/NAPT-PT: NAT-PT uses a pool of globally unique IPv4 addresses for assignment to IPv6 nodes on a dynamic basis as sessions are initiated across the IP version boundaries. NAT-PT binds addresses in IPv6 network with addresses in IPv4 network and vice versa to provide transparent routing between the two IP domains without requiring any changes to end points, like the UE. NAT-PT needs to track the sessions it supports and mandates that inbound and outbound data for a specific session traverse the same NAT-PT router.\n\tNAPT-PT provides additional translation of transport identifier (e.g. TCP and UDP port numbers, ICMP query identifiers). This allows the transport identifiers of a number of IPv6 hosts to be multiplexed into the transport identifiers of a single assigned IPv4 address.

The main functionalities introduced here are the support of redundant transmission, QoS monitoring, dynamic division of the Packet Delay Budget, and enhancements of the session continuity mechanism.\nRedundant transmission for high-reliability communication\nSome URLLC services request very high reliability that hardly can be supported in an economical way by a single transport path. To support such services, a redundant transmission mechanism is specified. User packets are duplicated and simultaneously transferred to the receiver via two disjoint user plane paths. The redundant packets are then eliminated at the receiver side. With this, service failure can be avoided even in case the packet transmission via one path occasionally fails or exceeds the delay requirement. \nDifferent options are specified to support redundant transmission at different layers (figures extracted from 23.501):\n\n6.23\tQoS monitoring \n6.23.1\tDescription \nThe QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC services, vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate QoS guarantees from the network. However, the network cannot always guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that the application and/or application server is notified in a timely manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.\nFor more information on QoS assurance see Annex F. \nVertical automation systems are locally distributed and are typically served by wired and wireless communication networks of different types and with different characteristics. If the operation of the system or one of its sub-processes does not work properly, there is a need for quickly finding and eliminating the related error or fault in order to avoid significant operation and thus financial losses.

URLLC is used in 5G SA (Stand-alone) networking to meet ultra-low latency requirements. Real-time interactive services are mainly small-packet transmission services, which do not require network bandwidth but require ultra-low latency. For industrial-grade URLLC services, too big delay may cause service failures instead of performance problems. Therefore, it is important to analyze the delay and the delay fulfillment boundary. \nFurthermore, the packet loss is also an important factor to be considered. As URLLC refers to \u201cultra-reliability\u201d and packet loss is one of the most important factors to reflect reliability. If the packet loss rate is too high, the control instruction fails. Therefore, the packet loss rate and the threshold of the packet loss rate need to be considered when defining the quality indicator for the service.\n\n4.4.2\tPotential solutions\n4.4.2.1\tPotential solution #1: KQIs for URLLC\n4.4.2.1.1\tIntroduction\nIn this potential solution, KQIs for URLLC is provided.\n4.4.2.1.2\tDescription\nEnd-to-end delay is an important indicator for end users to perceive the quality of the service. In URLLC real-time transmission services, ultra-low latency are required. For industrial-grade URLLC services, if the delay does not meet the requirements, it may lead to service failures.\nUplink/downlink average packet loss rate and uplink/downlink burst packet loss rate are important indicators which will influence the quality of the service. As URLLC are required to be ultra-reliability and minimum packet loss plays the most important role.

CFRA is not supported for SDT over RACH.\nOnce initiated, the SDT procedure is either:\n-\tsuccessfully completed after the UE is directed to RRC_IDLE (via RRCRelease) or to continue in RRC_INACTIVE (via RRCRelease or RRCReject) or to RRC_CONNECTED (via RRCResume or RRCSetup); or\n\nSDT procedure over CG resources can only be initiated with valid UL timing alignment. The UL timing alignment is maintained by the UE based on a SDT-specific timing alignment timer configured by the network via dedicated signalling and, for initial CG-SDT transmission, also by DL RSRP of configured number of highest ranked SSBs which are above a configured RSRP threshold. Upon expiry of the SDT-specific timing alignment timer, the CG resources are released while maintaining the CG resource configuration.\nLogical channel restrictions configured by the network while in RRC_CONNECTED state and/or in RRCRelease message for radio bearers enabled for SDT, if any, are applied by the UE during SDT procedure.\nThe network may configure UE to apply ROHC continuity for SDT either when the UE initiates SDT in the PCell of the UE when the RRCRelease with suspend indication was received or when the UE initiates SDT in a cell of its RNA.\nFor SDT procedure over CG resources, the network may configure maximum time duration until the next valid CG occasion for initial CG-SDT transmission based on which the UE decides whether SDT procedure over CG resources can be initiated.

This is a crucial step for establishing assurance about the fulfillment of the customer's requirements.\nFigure F.1-1: QoS assurance by use of QoS monitoring information\nNOTE: This Figure is based on the trust model in reference [18].\nThe start time and the duration of the QoS monitoring is specified in the parameter observation time interval, which is exchanged between the customer, for instance an application consuming a communication service, and the provider (for instance a private 5G network providing a communication service). The observation time interval is the time interval during which a series of measurements is conducted. In the context of QoS monitoring, these are the measurements necessary for assessing the QoS of communication services, for instance the measurement of end-to-end latencies.\n\n6.23\tQoS monitoring \n6.23.1\tDescription \nThe QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC services, vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate QoS guarantees from the network. However, the network cannot always guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that the application and/or application server is notified in a timely manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.\nFor more information on QoS assurance see Annex F. \nVertical automation systems are locally distributed and are typically served by wired and wireless communication networks of different types and with different characteristics. If the operation of the system or one of its sub-processes does not work properly, there is a need for quickly finding and eliminating the related error or fault in order to avoid significant operation and thus financial losses.

The PRA information includes both the PRA ID and the PRA list.\nPredefined PRA: the PRA list has been predefined in the MME, and the PCRF only needs to indicate the PRA IDs so as to activate the corresponding PRAs in the MME.\n\n6.30\tSolution #30: Improve correctness of NWDAF analytics\n6.30.1\tDescription\nThis is a solution for Key Issue #1: \"How to improve correctness of NWDAF analytics\".\nAfter MTLF providing one or multiple ML models related to an analytics ID to the AnLF, based on some specific monitoring mechanism, the analytics correctness for the one model or multiple models can be evaluated by the AnLF or MTLF. The analytics correctness evaluation result (e.g. Accuracy in Use or MAE in Use, etc.) will be obtained or reported to the MTLF meanwhile with the model usage scope for each model, which indicates the target scope (area, DNN, S-NSSSAI and target UE(s)) the model is used in the real network.\nBy updating the model repeatedly, or choosing from the multiple models, the MTLF will get a model with good enough performance e.g. according to analytics correctness evaluation result (e.g. Accuracy in Use or MAE in Use, etc.). The MTLF stores the model information with and its corresponding model usage scope.\nWhen the same AnLF (e.g. due to abnormal loss of model information) or some other AnLF subscribes a trained ML model to the MTLF, if the requested analytics ID and model filter information matches with the model information, then the MTLF provides it to the requested AnLF.\n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What does the AULC feature improve?

In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.\n\n-\tCritical Communications (CC) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC): Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very high communications service availability. These are driven by the new services such as industrial automation. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a server which may be outside the 5G system, and data processing. Some of these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections between the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for example, to allow local hosting of the services. The scenarios and their performance requirements can be found in table 7.2.2-1 of TS\u00a022.261\u00a0[1].

This Work Item specifies a solution for the required OAM support.\nThe LSA Architecture Reference Model is described in [7]. It is based on a LSA Repository (LR) and LSA Controller (LC) with the LSA1 reference point between them. The WI OAM support for Licensed Shared Access (LSA) provides functionality for connecting the LC to the 3GPP Management System. Two deployment scenarios are considered:\nDeployment scenario 1: The LSA controller (LC) communicates LSA spectrum resource availability information (LSRAI) received from the LR to the NM.\nDeployment scenario 2: The LSA controller performs planning decisions (some or all) based on the LSRAI received from the LR internally and communicates the calculated constraints on configuration attributes (max TX power, allowed down tilt range, allowed azimuth range, maximum antenna height, etc\u2026) to the NM.\n\nFor example, LTE-WiFi Aggregation (LWA) and License Assisted Access (LAA) are two features whereby a UE is connected to two access technologies at the same time, i.e., a primary access and a secondary access, where the secondary access technology operates in unlicensed spectrum.\n33.2\tRequirements\nThe 3GPP network shall be able to identify traffic which was transported over unlicensed access.\n34\tVoid\n34.1\tVoid\n34.2\tVoid\n35\tRestricted local operator services\n35.1\tDescription\nAccess to restricted local operator services by unauthenticated UEs is based on FCC regulations in the U.S. related to manual roaming as noted in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 Chapter 1 Subchapter B Part 20 Section 20.3 and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 Chapter 1 Subchapter B Part 20 Section 20.12 (Resale and Roaming) Subparagraph c [60].  \nThe restricted local operator services offered by an operator are out of scope of 3GPP.

Such messages can be standard VRU messages (e.g. VAM) and other V2X messages (CAM, DENM, BSM, CPM) and can be exchanged via different transmission modes (unicast, groupcast, broadcast).\nIn such scenario, one challenge is that a pedestrian UE might have a lower battery capacity and limited radio capability, and therefore may have to work in a low power consumption mode, e.g. not being able to send/receive V2X messages with the same periodicity as a Vehicular UE. Continuous sending/receiving V2X messages by the pedestrian UE would affect UE power efficiency. A further challenge is that multiple applications related to VRU may be deployed, which may have differentiated traffic/QoS requirements as well as transmission/reception schedules. \n\n\n`\n\nSelect the correct option for the question below\n\nQuestion: \n('What is the purpose of GNSS in V2V communications?
